============================
Plan events through projects
============================

This module allows you to assign a project to an event. This project will
inherit its event's name an its due date will be set as the event's begining
date.

Change the event's begining date or its name so the project's due date and name
will be changed. And all the project pending tasks will be retro-planned
according to the new date.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Create a project or duplicate an existing one that fits your needs.
#. Go to an event or create a brand new one and assign the previous project.
#. The project will inherit its name and will fit its end date to the begging of
   the event.
