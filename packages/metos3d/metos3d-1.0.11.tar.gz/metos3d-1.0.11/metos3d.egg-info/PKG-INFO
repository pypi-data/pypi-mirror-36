        ## About Metos3D
        
        ### What is Metos3D?
        
        Metos3D is a collection of
        
        - simulation software ([simpack](simpack/README.md))
        - optimization software ([optpack](optpack/README.md))
        - chemical / biogeochemical / marine ecosystem [models](https://github.com/metos3d/model/)
        - transport and forcing [data](https://github.com/metos3d/data/)
        
        that is based on the [Transport Matrix Method](https://github.com/samarkhatiwala/tmm).
        
        ### What is Metos3D for?
        
        Metos3D can be used for
        
        - simulation of
        - computation of annual periodic steady-states of
        - parameter estimates for
        
        chemical / biogeochemical / marine ecosystem models coupled to global 3-D ocean circulation.
        
        See: [[Piwonski and Slawig, 2016]](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/3729/2016/)
        
        ### Why was Metos3D developed?
        
        In the field of climate research and ocean simulation, marine ecosystem models still entail the most uncertainties.
        Therefore
        
        - an application programming interface for biogeochemical models [BGC API](https://github.com/jpicau/metos3d/blob/master/docs/metos3d-reference.html) was designed and
        - a comprehensive, state-of-the-art, high-performance software based on [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/index.html) was built around it.
        
        See: [[Piwonski and Slawig, 2016]](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/3729/2016/)
        
        ### How do I use Metos3D?
        
        Have a look into the [Metso3D Documentation](docs/README.md).
