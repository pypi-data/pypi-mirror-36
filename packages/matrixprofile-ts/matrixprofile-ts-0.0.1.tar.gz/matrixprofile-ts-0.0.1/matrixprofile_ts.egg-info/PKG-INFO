        ## What is matrixprofile?
        matrixprofile is a Python library for evaluating time series data using the matrix profile algorithms developed by the Keough and Mueen research groups at the University of California-Riverside and the University of New Mexico. Current algorithms implemented include MASS, STMP, STAMP and STAMPI.
