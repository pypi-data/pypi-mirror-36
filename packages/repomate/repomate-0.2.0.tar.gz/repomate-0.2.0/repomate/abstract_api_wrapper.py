"""Contains an abstract class defining an interface to a GitHub API.

Provides an abstract class that defines all of the functions required by the
:py:class:`repomate.github_api.GitHubAPI` class' internal API. The idea is to
completely separate :py:class:`repomate.github_api.GitHubAPI` from the API calls to the *actual*
GitHub API, so that the latter can be swapped out more easily. In theory,
any implementation of :py:class:`AbstractAPIWrapper` should be usable as the
API layer toward GitHub. The interface is however heavily influenced by the
fact that that it was created with regards to the REST v3 API, so utilizing
e.g. the GraphQL API efficiently may require some modification.

The currently used implementation of :py:class:`AbstractAPIWrapper` is defined
by the package level constant :py:const:`APIWrapper`.

Current implementations:

.. module:: abstract_api_wrapper
   :synopsis: Abstract class defining the interface required for the internal API of repomate.github_api.GitHubAPI.
