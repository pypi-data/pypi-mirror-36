"""GitHub API module.

This module contains the :py:class:`GitHubAPI` class, which is meant to be the
prime means of interacting with the GitHub API in ``repomate``. The methods of
GitHubAPI are mostly high-level bulk operations.

The :py:class:`APIWrapper` class is an abstraction layer for the actual API
used to communicate with GitHub.
