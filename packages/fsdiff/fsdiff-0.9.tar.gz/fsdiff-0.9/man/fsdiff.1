.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
fsdiff is a very simple tool used to compare recursively the filesystem
directory and file structure.
It does not only perform a quick (shallow) comparison using
\f[C]os.stat\f[] (stat system call), it also compares the contents of
the files.

In case they differ, it displays a brief summary report.
It is also installed as a Python packaged, so it can be used likewise.
.PP
Example run: \f[C]sudo\ fsdiff\ rootfs\ bootfs\f[]

For a more detailed investigation a deep checking tool like diffoscope
or Beyond Compare, may be used.
.PP
To install you need to run \f[C]pip3\ install\ fsdiff\f[], with either
super user privileges or with the \f[C]\-\-user\f[] flag.

\f[C]subprocess.run\f[] method as well as the cache clearing from the
directory compare library.
