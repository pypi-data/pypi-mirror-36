Description: Python Gateway for fjage
        ========================
        
        This python package provides a `Gateway` class to interact with the fjage agents. The fjage agents reside in one or more containers that provide agent management, directory and messaging services. Various containers may run on the same node or on different nodes in a network. fjage uses JSON for communication between remote containers. The JSON objects are exchanged over some low level networked connection protocol like TCP. This package allows the developers to interact with fjage agents using an interface implemented in python. The python APIs use the package `fjagepy`.
