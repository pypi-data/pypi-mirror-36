        RDDL2TensorFlow compiler and trajectory simulator in Python3.
        
        # Quickstart
        
        ```text
        $ pip3 install rddl2tf
        ```
        
        # Compiler
        
        ## Parameterized Variables (pvariables)
        
        Each RDDL fluent is compiled to a ``rddl2tf.TensorFluent`` after instantiation.
        
        A ``rddl2tf.TensorFluent`` object wraps a ``tf.Tensor`` object. The arity and the number of objects corresponding to the type of each parameter of a fluent are reflected in a ``rddl2tf.TensorFluentShape`` object (the rank of a ``rddl2tf.TensorFluent`` corresponds to the fluent arity and the size of its dimensions corresponds to the number of objects of each type). Also, a ``rddl2tf.TensorFluentShape`` manages batch sizes when evaluating operations in batch mode.
        
        Additionally, a ``rddl2tf.TensorFluent``keeps information about the ordering of the fluent parameters in a ``rddl2tf.TensorScope`` object.
        
        The ``rddl2tf.TensorFluent`` abstraction is necessary in the evaluation of RDDL expressions due the broadcasting rules of operations in TensorFlow.
        
        
        ## Conditional Probability Functions (CPFs)
        
        Each CPF expression is compiled into an operation in a ``tf.Graph``, possibly composed of many other operations. Typical RDDL operations, functions, and probability distributions are mapped to equivalent TensorFlow ops. These operations are added to a ``tf.Graph`` by recursively compiling the expressions in a CPF into wrapped operations and functions implemented at the ``rddl2tf.TensorFluent`` level.
        
        Note that the RDDL2TensorFlow compiler currently only supports element-wise operations (e.g. ``a(?x, ?y) = b(?x) * c(?y)`` is not allowed). However, all compiled operations are vectorized, i.e., computations are done simultaneously for all object instantiations of a pvariable.
        
        Optionally, during simulation operations can be evaluated in batch mode. In this case, state-action trajectories are generated in parallel by the ``rddl2tf.Simulator``.
