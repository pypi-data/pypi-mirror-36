  name: "KAPA RNA-Seq pipeline: BBDuk - STAR - featureCounts"
  version: 0.0.1
  description: "This RNA-seq pipeline is comprised of three steps: preprocessing, alignment, and
    quantification.\n\nFirst, reads are preprocessed by __BBDuk__ which removes adapters, trims
    reads for quality from the 3'-end, and discards reads that are too short after trimming.
    Compared to similar tools, BBDuk is regarded for its computational efficiency.\n\nNext,
    preprocessed reads are aligned by __STAR__ aligner. At the time of implementation, STAR is
    considered a state-of-the-art tool that consistently produces accurate results from diverse sets
    of reads, and performs well even with default settings. For more information see [this
    comparison of RNA-seq aligners](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4106).\n\nFinally, aligned
    reads are summarized to genes by __featureCounts__. Gaining wide adoption among the
    bioinformatics community, featureCounts yields expressions in a computationally efficient
    manner.\n\nAll three tools in this workflow support parallelization to accelerate the analysis."
