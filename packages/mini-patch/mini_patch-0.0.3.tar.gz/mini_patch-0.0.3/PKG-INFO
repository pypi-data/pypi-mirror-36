Description: Do you have textual or binary data that you need to patch?
        
        ```
        >>> a = 'you say yes, i say no'
        >>> b = 'you say stop, and i say go go go'
        ```
        
        But you want a smaller patchfile than what difflib's `unified_diff()` creates?
        
        ```
        >>> diff = '\n'.join(difflib.unified_diff(a, b))
        >>> len(diff)
        137
        ```
        
        `mini_patch` also uses difflib's `SequenceMatcher` machinery, but it creates
        tiny patches:
        
        ```
        >>> patch = mini_patch.make_mini_patch(a.encode('utf-8'), b.encode('utf-8'))
        >>> patch
        '0!d:8,2;i:11,$4$dG9w;i:12,$8$IGFuZA==;r:19,1,$4$Zw==;i:21,$8$IGdvIGdv;'
        >>> len(patch)
        70
        ```
