Description: # Jet Killer
        
        Jet Killer converts images using the "jet" colormap to a better
        one (by default "viridis") by using directly the pixel values,
        without any knowledge about the underlying data.
        
        It can be used as a tool to enhance data visualizations for which
        the original dataset is unavailable. Use cases include :
        
        * enhancing figures from sources who made an unfortunate
          colormap choice,
        * enhancing graphs for which the original data may be lost,
        * enhancing visualizations without having to regenerate it from the
          original dataset.

        ## Installation
        
        The following command installs the `jetkiller` command
        and the `jetkiller` package:
        
        ```
        pip install jetkiller
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### From the command line
        
        Jet Killer is designed to be used mainly from the command line.
        
        Use the following command to convert `input_file` to `output_file`:
        
        ```
        jetkiller input_file output_file
        ```
        
        If you omit the argument `output_file`, Jet Killer converts
        `input_file` to "output.png" by default:
        
        ```
        jetkiller input_file
        ```
        
        If the file "output.png" already exists, it is overwritten without any
        warning.
        
        You can change the output colormap (by default "viridis") with
        the `--colormap` option. Any value from the
        [matplotlib colormaps](https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html)
        is recognized. Here is an example using the colormap "inferno":
        
        ```
        jetkiller input_file output_file --colormap inferno
        ```
        
        ### From Python
        
        If you wish to use Jet Killer from Python, you can
        import the `jetkiller` package and use the `jetkiller` function:
        
        ```python
        import jetkiller as jk
        jk.jetkiller("input_image.png", "output_image.png")
        ```
        
        The second argument is optional and defaults to "output.png", so that
        you can write:
        
        ```python
        import jetkiller as jk
        jk.jetkiller("input_image.png")
        ```
        
        If the file "output.png" already exists, it is overwritten without any
        warning.
        
        You can change the output colormap (by default "viridis") with
        the `colormap` arugment. Any value from the
        [matplotlib colormaps](https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html)
        is recognized.
        
        ```python
        import jetkiller as jk
        jk.jetkiller("input_image.png", "output_image.png", colormap="inferno")
        ```
