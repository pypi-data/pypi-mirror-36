        Installation
        ------------
        pip
        ^^^
        You can install ``evilmc`` with pip (recommended):
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install evilmc
        
        From source
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        You can also install directly from source. The most current `stable release <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/evilmc/>`_ is up on PyPI.
        
        
        Unpack the distribution with ``tar -xvf`` and navigate to the source root directory.  To install, run the setup script:
        
        ::
        
           $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        Note that you'll need to ``cd`` out of the source directory **before** you can import ``evilmc``.
