Ez Spotity DL
=============

Don't you think would be cool if you could donwload your playlists from your Spotify account, don't you?
So, the **Ez Spotify DL** can do that for you. Plus, in an easy way.



## Install

Assuming that you have *pip* installed, open the console/terminal execute:

```bash
$ pip install ez-spotify-dl
```

use --user flag if you don't want to install on system-wide mode

```bash
$ pip install --user ez-spotify-dl
```
or download/clone the package, go to project folder and

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

as the same as using pip you can insert the --user flag

```bash
$ python setup.py install --user
```

## Usage

1 - Getting Spotify's api authorization.

```bash
$ spotify_dl --authorize
```
**HINT:** At this moment you will be guided by **Ez Spotify DL**, just follow the interactive instructions that will appear to you. So, you don't need to follow this usage guide if you don't wanna. I really think that **Ez Spotify DL** interactive instructions are enough.
Well, it's up to you.

2 - Insert your Spotify username.

3 - Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.

4 - Authenticate.

5 - Go back to terminal where you started the **Ez Spotify DL** and press CTRL+C.

6 - Execute:
```bash
$ spotify_dl -d <path_where_you_want_download_your_playlists>
```

7 - Wait your playlists get downloaded.

**WARNING:** Make sure you are creating playlists containing at maximum 100 tracks.
It's due Spotify API limits at 100 the amount of tracks returned per playlist.

For more information execute:
```bash
$ spotify_dl -h
```

That's all.
