# Planet-Mosaic-Quads-Download-CLI

Planet creates global monthly mosaics apart from creating mosaics at different frequencies, monthly mosaics are of interest to a lot of people who would like to do a consistent time series analysis using these mosaics and would like to apply them to an existing analytical pipeline. I created this tool to allow you pass single or multiple geometries in a folder for the tool to find the mosaic quads and then process and download it. For now the geometry is passed as a geojson file, but I have included a tool for you to convert any shapefile into geojson files so you can use this tool. In the future I will add support for kml and json files as well.

## Installation
This assumes that you have native python & pip installed in your system, you can test this by going to the terminal (or windows command prompt) and trying

```python``` and then ```pip list```

If you get no errors and you have python 2.7.14 or higher you should be good to go. Please note that I have tested this only on python 2.7.15 but it should run on python 3.

To install **pbasemap: Planet Mosaic Quads Download CLI** you can install using two methods

```pip install pbasemap```

or you can also try

```
git clone https://github.com/samapriya/Planet-Mosaic-Quads-Download-CLI.git
cd pbasemap
python setup.py install
```
For linux use sudo.

Installation is an optional step; the application can be also run directly by executing pbasemap.py script. The advantage of having it installed is being able to execute ppipe as any command line tool. I recommend installation within virtual environment. If you don't want to install, browse into the pbasemap folder and try ```python pbasemap.py``` to get to the same result.


## Getting started

As usual, to print help:

```
pbasemap -h
usage: pbasemap [-h]
              {mosaic_list,download_quad,download_metadata,shp2geojson} ...

Planet Mosaic Quads Download CLI

positional arguments:
  {mosaic_list,download_quad,download_metadata,shp2geojson}
    mosaic_list         Tool to get Mosaic & Bounding Box list
    download_quad       Download quad GeoTiffs
    download_metadata   Download Quad Metadata
    shp2geojson         Convert all shapefiles in folder to GeoJSON

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  ```

To obtain help for a specific functionality, simply call it with _help_ switch, e.g.: `pbasemap zipshape -h`. If you didn't install pbasemap, then you can run it just by going to *pbasemap* directory and running `python pbasemap.py [arguments go here]`

## pbasemap Simple CLI for Earth Engine Uploads
The tool allows you to mass both single and multiple geometries and processes mosaics within a yearly range. Meaning it will download all monthly mosaics within a year. A finer control will not be implemented since this is designed to be part of a larger yearly assessment toolchain. But a user can go into the idl.csv file created by the tool and remove the rows with the mosaics they do not want to be downloaded.

### mosaic list
This tool allows you to pass a folder with geojson geometries for which you want the mosaic quads to be downloaded. It then creates an internal list to be used by the downloader to then download your mosaic quads.

```
usage: pbasemap mosaic_list [-h] [--local LOCAL] [--start START] [--end END]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --local LOCAL  Choose folder with geojson files
  --start START  Choose Start Year
  --end END      Choose End Year
```

### download mosaic
As the name suggests this downloads your mosaic to the local folder you specify, you can specify how much coverage you want over your geometry and over the quad. So you may decide to only download those mosaic quads that have coverage more than 90% by simply specifying ```--coverage "90"``` in the arguments.

```
usage: pbasemap download_quad [-h] [--local LOCAL] [--coverage COVERAGE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --local LOCAL        Choose folder to download images
  --coverage COVERAGE  Choose minimum percentage coverage
```

### download mosaic metadata
Though typically the mosaic quads don't come with metadata, I decided to create metadata using the json response and some of the custom fields I though would be useful and this tool allows you to download that. This does not require geometry and exports only the global

```
usage: pbasemap download_metadata [-h] [--start START] [--end END]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --start START  Choose Start Year
  --end END      Choose End Year
  --local LOCAL  Full path where you want the metadata exported
```

### shape to geojson
This tool allows you to convert from  a folder with multiple shapefiles to a folder with geojson that can then be used with the tool. It makes use of geopandas and reprojects your shapefile to make it compatible while passing onto the API for search and download.

```
usage: pbasemap shp2geojson [-h] [--source SOURCE] [--destination DESTINATION]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --source SOURCE       Choose Source Folder
  --destination DESTINATION
                        Choose Destination Folder
```
