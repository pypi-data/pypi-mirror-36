* Initialise classification table in valve\_pipeline
* remove unnecessary reference to classification\_table
* Use valve\_pipeline to manage egress table
* Pipeline manager manages hosts
* wait\_for\_route\_as\_flow() needs to be more patient (10s sometimes not enough to wait for unresponsive nexthops while re-resolving during test)

* Rand VID test might pick same VID
* Group test needs to reset combinatorial\_port\_flood
* Exclude multiple LACP members from controller initiated flooding
* Consistently enable combinatorial flooding for special cases
* Don't add no-op pop vlan if no untagged ports to flood to
* pylint
* pylint
* pylint
* Two state Prometheus filter
* flow dumper now requires table ID always, and keeps most recent table dump
* Use Prometheus not log scraping for StackRingTest
* readd only

1.8.22
------

* Move LACP active to fast\_advertise()

* Refactor into fast/regular expiry/advertise
* Bump version for release
* LACP can cause a loop
* Right size LACP packet on receipt
* debug log LACP
* LACP active should set active flag
* Some OFAs can't get mask on eth\_dst rule
* Avoid unnnecessary flowmods cold starting LACP port. Strictly verify LACP packet size
* LACP content change
* Rate limit LACP response
* Reply to LACP packets if different at all, or only after 1s if the same
* Only attempt to set non-0 metadata fields in TFM
* Disable metadata write/match if egress pipeline not in use
* Increase max len for LACP
* Use actor sync flag for LACP state not local
