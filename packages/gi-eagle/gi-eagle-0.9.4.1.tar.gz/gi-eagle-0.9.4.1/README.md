# Eagle #

The exome analysis graphical environment (Eagle) is a webbased user interface for exonic data analysis.

## Installation ##

### by conda (Python 3) ###

Using conda (bioconda) is the easiest way to install Eagle

```
conda install -c bioconda eagle
```

### by pip ###

An alternative to conda is pip

```
pip install gi-eagle
```

### by setup.py ###

You can install Eagle by running setup.py from a cloned repository

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:christopherschroeder/eagle.git
cd eagle
python setup.py install
```

## Create the data-files ##

Instead of a central database Eagle stores the genetic information in structured h5 files. These files are created on [SnpEff and SnpSift](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net) annotated [vcfs](http://www.internationalgenome.org/wiki/Analysis/vcf4.0/) and created as follows. As an example we assume having a vcf files named *example.vcf*, based on hg38 and containing the two samples *sampleA* and *sampleB*. Furthermore we assume a [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/) vcf file stored as *150.vcf.gz* ([download](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b150_GRCh38p7/VCF/All_20170710.vcf.gz)).


Step 1. Annotate the vcf file
```
snpeff -noStats -t hg38 example.vcf | snpsift annotate -tabix 150.vcf.gz - > example.annotated.vcf
```

Step 2. Use eagle to convert the vcf file
```
eagle convert --samples sampleA sampleB example.annotated.vcf data
```
This creates two sample specific data files *data/sampleA.h5* and *data/sampleB.h5*.



## Create the config ##
Eagle requires a configuration file to run, containing path information to the previously created data files and to corresponding bam files. The config syntax follows the python [supported INI file structure](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure) with a *pathes* and a *reference* section.
Example config file *config.cfg*
```
[pathes]
snp: /vol/home/me/data/h5
bam: /vol/home/me/data/bam
group: /vol/home/me/data/groups

[reference]
version: hg38
```
The *snp* key contains the path to the data files, *bam* key the path to the corresponding bam files and *group* the path to a directory where Eagle stores custom sample groups. Please note that Eagle requires identical file basenames to match bam and h5, e.g. *sampleA.bam* and *sampleA.h5*.

## Running ##

### Local ###
The interface is launched by
```
eagle interface --config config.cfg
```
with a given previously created *cfg* file. Per default the local webserver is running on port 8000 and is accessed under *http://127.0.0.1:8000* or *http://localhost:8000*, if the system's defaults are not customized.

### Intranet ###
The previous command allows local access of the web-interface. The *public* flag provides public access:

```
eagle interface --config config.cfg --public
```

### Public ###
It is often necessary for production systems to simulataniously provide access to multiple independent server instances.
A common practice is to apply proxies, which forward url requests to different intranet servers and instances running on different ports.
Assuming we have two servers.

A server name *gate.local* provides external access, while a second server *my_server.local* runs an eagle instance on port 10001.

To use Eagle in such configuration, we suggest to apply [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) as a proxy on *gate.local*.
The nginx configuration entry for our example 

```
    location /eagle/myeagle {
        auth_basic            "Restricted";
        auth_basic_user_file  /vol/home/foo/eagle/.htpasswd;
        rewrite /eagle/rb_zelllinien/(.*) /$1 break;
        proxy_pass http://my_server.local:10001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Script-Name /eagle/myeagle;
        proxy_read_timeout 500;
    }
```
Please note that this configuration requires a [htpasswd](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/) file stored in /vol/home/foo/eagle, which is required for restricted access and user/password authentication.

After authentication, the proxie will now internally tunnel any request for http://gate.local/eagle/myeagle to http://my_server.local:10001

Please also note that the public flag is required, if Eagle is not executed locally on *gate.local*.
