        `hawkeslib` started with the ambition of having a simple Python implementation
        of *plain-vanilla* Hawkes (or *self-exciting* processes), i.e. those
        with factorized triggering kernels with exponential decay functions.
        
        The [docs](http://hawkeslib.rtfd.io/) contain tutorials, examples and a detailed API reference.
        For other examples, see the `examples/` folder.
        
        The following models are available:
        
        - Univariate Hawkes Process (with exponential delay)
        - Bayesian Univariate Hawkes Process (with exponential delay)
        - Poisson Process
        - 'Bayesian' Poisson process
        
        Bayesian variants implement methods for sampling from the posterior as well as calculating
        marginal likelihood (e.g. for Bayesian model comparison).
        
        ## Installation
        
        `Cython` (>=0.28) and `numpy` (>=1.14) must be installed prior to the installation.
        
        ```
        $ pip install -U Cython numpy hawkeslib
        ```
