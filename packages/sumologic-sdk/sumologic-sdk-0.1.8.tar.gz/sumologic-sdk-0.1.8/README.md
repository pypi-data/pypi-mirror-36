Sumo Logic Python SDK
=====================

Community-supported Python interface to the Sumo Logic REST API.  The idea is to make it easier to
hit the API in Python code.  Sample scripts available in the `scripts` folder.  Please submit issues
here via Github.  Do not submit customer issues to Sumo Logic support (but REST API issues are of 
course supported).

| In keeping with industry standard security best practices, as of May 31, 2018, the Sumo Logic service will only support TLS version 1.2 going forward. Verify that all connections to Sumo Logic endpoints are made from software that supports TLS 1.2. |
