SQL migrations for Postgres

Usage:
```
docker build -t iqueue/goose .

docker run \
  -it --rm \
  --name=goose-migrate \ 
  -e 'PGPASSWORD=top-secret' \
  -e 'DB_HOST=docker.for.mac.localhost' \
  -v "${PWD}/migrations:/opt/leantaas/migrations" \
  iqueue/goose
```

Where `${PWD}/migrations` is some directory of form:
```
./migrations
  1_up.sql
  1_down.sql
  2_up.sql
  2_down.sql
  3_up.sql
  3_down.sql
```

Current main difference from Play Framework migrations is that a migration in Goose is all-or-nothing.

E.g. you are on master branch on revision 5 and want to switch to a feature branch whose latest revision is 4'.
```
1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 <- 5  
       \
         3' <- 4' 
```
Applying migrations through Goose will leave you on either revision 5 (if an error is encountered) or revision 4' (if migration is successful) but not on any of 4, 3, 2, or 3'.
