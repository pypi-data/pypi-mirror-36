Description: # Query a Quantum Gateway
        
        This library allows a Verizon FiOS Quantum Gateway to be queried. It uses the `requests` library to authenticate, log in, and query the web interface of the gateway.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from quantum_gateway import QuantumGatewayScanner
        
        # Connect to gateway
        gateway = QuantumGatewayScanner('192.168.1.1', 'your_password_here')
        
        # Ensure successful connection
        gateway.success_init
        
        # Get list of all connected devices' MAC addresses
        gateway.scan_devices()
        
        # Get specific device's name
        gateway.get_device_name('mac address of device here')
        ```
        
        ## Thoughts
        
        I have only tested on my own Verizon FiOS-provided gateway:
