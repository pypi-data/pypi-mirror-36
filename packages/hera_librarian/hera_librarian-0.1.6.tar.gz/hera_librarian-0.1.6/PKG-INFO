Description: The HERA Librarian is a distributed system for managing HERA collaboration
        data products. This package provides client libraries that allow you to
        communicate with a Librarian server. It also includes the server code,
        although those modules are not installed in a standard ``pip install``.
        
        The Librarian client and server currently only run on Python 2.
