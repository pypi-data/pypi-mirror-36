FOSS_FINDER
-----------

The script is fairly easy to use but if you need any help, you can run:

```
python foss_finder_cli.py -h
```

The standard way to run the script is to get an access token for your GitHub organization, then run:

```
python foss_finder_cli.py -t <your_access_token> <name_of_your_organization>
```

Alternatively, you can directly use your GitHub username to login:

```
python foss_finder_cli.py -u <your_username> <name_of_your_organization>
```
