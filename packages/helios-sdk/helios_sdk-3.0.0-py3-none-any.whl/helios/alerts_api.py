    Helios alerts provide real-time severe weather alerts.

    **National Weather Service:**

    - Severe weather alerts for the United States are provided by the
      National Weather Service. These alerts cover events such as Flood
      Warnings, Severe Thunderstorm Warnings, and Special Weather Statements.

    **Helios:**

    - Alerts generated by Helios are based on the sensor measurements from
      the Observations API. These alerts represent regional areas with a high
      detection confidence and currently include: Road Wetness Watch, Poor
      Visibility Watch, and Heavy Precip Watch.
