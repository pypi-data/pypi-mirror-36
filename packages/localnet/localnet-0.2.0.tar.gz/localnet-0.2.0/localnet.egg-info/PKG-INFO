Description: Module and script to test local network membership (IPv4)
        ===========================================================
        
        A set of utility functions and a command-line script useful in testing local
        machine membership in IPv4 networks. Requires no external modules
        ("batteries-included" only).
        
        Command-line usage
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        #. Sample usage
        
        Test all network interfaces, and return success if any interface has an IP
        address in the 10.100.3.0/24 network:
           
           .. code-block:: bash
        		   
              user@localhost$ local_net 10.100.3.0/24; echo $?
              0
              user@localhost$
        
        Specific interfaces may be tested by inclusion of the -i/--iface flag, which
        may be repeated:
        
           .. code-block:: bash
        		
              user@localhost$ local_net -i etho -i wlan2 192.168.1.0/24
        
        Asserting that no local interface is a member of a given network is also
        possible by using the -n/--negate flag:
        
           .. code-block:: bash
        		   
              user@localhost$ local_net -n 10.1.0.0/16
        
        
        Test success or failure is indicated by exit status code - 0 for success, 1
        for failure. This allows for ease of use in conditional statements and other
        tests (e.g. ssh config 'exec' testing). Exit status 64 is returned if an
        unrecoverable error occurs (e.g. an interface was passed that does not exist),
        and error information may be written to stderr. Otherwise, no output is made.
        
        
        Requirements and compatibility
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        The code should work on any POSIX-compatible system, but has only been tested
        on modern Linux installs. Pull requests and bug reports for other operating
        systems are welcome. Supports Python versions 2.6+.  Python versions < 3.3
        require a system libc which supports if_nameindex() to get around lack of same
        in socket module.
