        ===========
        WARNING! THE PROJECT IS A RESTRUCTERING PHASE AND NOT VERY USEABLE FOR NEW USERS!
        
        What is skultrafast?
        ====================
        
        Skultrafast stands for scikit.ultrafast and is an
        python package which aims to include everthing
        needed to analyze data from time-resovled spectroscopy experiments in
        the femtosecond domain.
        
        Aims of the project
        -------------------
        I would include any kind of algorithm or data structure which
        comes up in ultrafast physics. Also, data exploration
        should be made easy (a.k.a. has a gui for these parts).
        
        Users
        -----
        At the moment it is mostly me and other people in my group. I would be happy
        if anyone would like to join the project!
        
        
        Software prerequisites
        =======================
        Python 3 only. Requiers numpy, scipy, lmfit, matplotlib, sklearn, statsmodels.
        
        For maximal speed python opencl should be installed.
