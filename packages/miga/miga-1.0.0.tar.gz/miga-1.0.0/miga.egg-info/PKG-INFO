Description: ========
          MIGA
        ========
        **MIGA** is a Python package that provides a MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) mutual information genetic algorithm optimizer. It sorts two MSAs in a way that maximize or minimize their mutual information. The genetic algorithm solvers may run on both CPU and Nvidia GPUs.
        
        Code is hosted at GitHub_.
