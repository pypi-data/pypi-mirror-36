        USAGE
        -----
        macvpnhelper [-h] [--duration DURATION] [--clickspeed CLICKSPEED]
                            [--fillpassword FILLPASSWORD] [--simulate] [--reset]
                            [--vpn VPN]
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          --duration DURATION, -d DURATION
                                (time in hours|'wd'|'fd') E.g., 8h, the amount of time
                                (in hours) to keep the VPN active. Use 'wd' to do 9-12
                                and 1-6 (default), or 'fd' to do 9-6.
          --clickspeed CLICKSPEED, -cs CLICKSPEED
                                (superfast|fast|normal|slow|superslow) adjust based on
                                responsiveness of your GUI
          --fillpassword FILLPASSWORD, -fp FILLPASSWORD
                                (yes|no|andReturn) type in password and optionally hit
                                return in the dialogs. CAUTION: since this password is
                                provided to the GUI, it is possible that intermediate
                                clicks will result in your password being typed to,
                                e.g., chat dialogs. Prevent this by using 'yes'
                                instead of 'andReturn', or making sure the clickspeed
                                matches your GUI responsiveness.
          --simulate, -s        When set, script which would be executed is instead
                                printed to the terminal.
          --reset               Use to reset your login information.
          --vpn VPN, -n VPN     Name of VPN to connect to. Must match your configured
                                connection.
