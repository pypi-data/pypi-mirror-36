class Sampler(TransformerMixin):

    Sample from a list of words, based on the frequency of those words.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : numpy array
        Your vectorized data.

    words : list of strings.
        The identities of the words.

    frequencies : numpy array or list of integers, default None.
        The frequencies of your input data. If this is None, the Sampler
        will sample uniformly.

    replacement : bool
        Whether to sample with or without replacement.

    Example
    -------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.random.seed(44)
    >>> from wordkit.samplers import Sampler
    >>> words = ["dog", "cat"]
    >>> frequencies = [10, 30]
    >>> s = Sampler(words, frequencies)
    >>> num_to_sample = 6
    >>> sampled_data = s.sample(num_to_sample)
    >>> sampled_data
