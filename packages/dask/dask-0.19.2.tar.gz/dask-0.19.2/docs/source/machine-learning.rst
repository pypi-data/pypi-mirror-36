Machine Learning
================

Dask facilitates machine learning, statistics, and optimization workloads in a
variety of ways.  Generally Dask tries to support other high-quality solutions
within the PyData ecosystem rather than reinvent new systems.  Dask makes it
easier to scale single-machine libraries like Scikit-Learn where possible and
makes using distributed libraries like XGBoost or Tensorflow more comfortable
for everyday users.

See the separate `Dask-ML documentation <https://dask-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ for more information.
