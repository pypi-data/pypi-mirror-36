Description: # GitOps
        
        Continuous delivery for your cluster.
        
        ## Overview
        
        Using CI/CD for applications is a wonderful technique to ease the pain of
        DevOps, wouldn't it be nice to apply the same workflow to cluster provisioning?
        
        GitOps integrates a multi-tenanted cluster with a GitHub repository. Changes
        made to the repository are sent to GitOps running on the cluster, which then
        provisions the calculated changes.
        
        Currently Kubernetes/Helm is the only supported cluster interface. All changes
        to the cluster are performed as applications of Helm charts.
