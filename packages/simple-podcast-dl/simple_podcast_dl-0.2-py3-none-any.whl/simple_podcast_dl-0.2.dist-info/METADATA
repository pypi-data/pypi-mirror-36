# Simple podcast downloader (podcatcher)

The simplest podcast downloader with no configuration, no tagging, no nothing.  
It simply downloads missing episodes from supported podcasts to a directory.  
*That's it.*

You don't even have to know the URL of the RSS, you can give it a website URL,  
a domain name, or simply the podcast name, it will find out which podcast you want to download.  

It doesn't have a complicated UI or fancy features, it's just a command line application.  
The download folder and the number of threads can be customized.

I use it in a Jenkins job to synchronize all the episodes to [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/),  
so it will be synced to my phone and I can listen the episodes without internet connection.
