[CA Cert]

[Client Cert]
# The name of your first human client

[Server Cert]
# Should be your server's canonical name
common_name=quux.baz.com

# The following list should include every viable name for your server
# as addressed by any potential Remote SGE clients, INCLUDING the canonical name above.
# If you plan on using IP address only, you can remove the DNS names from here.

DNS.2  = localhost

# IPv4 loopback address
IP.1   = 127.0.0.1
# IPv6 loopback address
IP.2   = ::1
# I haven't tested it but I'm guessing that for EC2 hosts this needs to be
# the public IP address, not the address listed on the public interface of the instance.
# You can safely remove this if you plan on using DNS names only for reaching the server.
