# ATC AI
Contains
* A program that helps minimize air crashes by 
using Machine Learning to control air traffic.
* A gym environment for ATC simulation
## Implementing
* `env.render()` is not implemented, running it will raise `NotImplementedError`.
* `env.reset()` opens the GUI.
* `env.fps` contains the fps to run the game at. You can set it using:
    ```python
    env.fps = 60
    ```
## Installation
For the latest installation (may be unstable) 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivek3141/atc-ai
pip install -e .
```
Install stable release by
```bash
pip install snake_gym
```

## Creating The Environment
The environment can be created by doing the following:
```python
import gym
import atc_gym
env = gym.make("atc-v0")
```

## Environments
* `atc-v0` Returns a NxN RGB image in the form of a numpy array for the observations
* `atc-tiled-v0` Returns a NxN matrix for the observations.
<br>
N is undecided until implementation
