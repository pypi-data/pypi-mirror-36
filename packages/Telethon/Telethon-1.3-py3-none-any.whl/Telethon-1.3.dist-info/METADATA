  ⭐️ Thanks **everyone** who has starred the project, it means a lot!

|logo| **Telethon** is an `asyncio
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ **Python 3** library
to interact with Telegram's API.

**If you're upgrading from Telethon pre-1.0 to 1.0, please make sure to read**
`this section of the documentation
<https://telethon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extra/basic/asyncio-magic.html>`_,
or ``pip install telethon-sync`` which is compatible with `synchronous code
<https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/tree/sync>`_. Don't forget to remove
the asynchronous version (``pip uninstall telethon``) if you do install sync.

What is this?
-------------

Telegram is a popular messaging application. This library is meant
to make it easy for you to write Python programs that can interact
with Telegram. Think of it as a wrapper that has already done the
heavy job for you, so you can focus on developing an application.


Installing
----------

.. code:: sh

  pip3 install telethon


Creating a client
-----------------

.. code:: python

    from telethon import TelegramClient, sync

    # These example values won't work. You must get your own api_id and
    # api_hash from https://my.telegram.org, under API Development.
    api_id = 12345
    api_hash = '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef'

    client = TelegramClient('session_name', api_id, api_hash)
    client.start()


Doing stuff
-----------

.. code:: python

    print(client.get_me().stringify())

    client.send_message('username', 'Hello! Talking to you from Telethon')
    client.send_file('username', '/home/myself/Pictures/holidays.jpg')

    client.download_profile_photo('me')
    messages = client.get_messages('username')
    messages[0].download_media()
