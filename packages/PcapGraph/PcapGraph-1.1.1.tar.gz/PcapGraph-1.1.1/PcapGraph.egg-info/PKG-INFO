Description: # PcapGraph
        Creates bar graphs out of packet capture timestamps.
        
        ![Alt text](https://github.com/pocc/pcapgraph/blob/master/examples/pcap_graph.png?raw=true "An example graph.")
        
        *This project requires features from **python3.6**. It would be prudent to use 
        this version of python or later.*
        
        #### Platforms
        Linux, Macos, Windows
        
        #### Description
        PcapGraph takes packet captures and creates a bar graph out of the start/end
        timestamps. If the --compare option is used, packet captures are compared 
        packet by packet to find what percentage of traffic is the same. A list of 
        files, directories, and any combination thereof can be specified.
        
        ## Use case
        ### Scenario
        * You have a bunch of packet captures all from multiple interfaces on a 
        network
        * You need to verify that they were taken at the same time and contain the 
        same packets 
         
        ### Solution
        Use pcapgraph to visually see where there is time and traffic overlap.
        
        ## Installation
        ### Steps
        ##### 1. Install Wireshark
        * These package managers have it in their repositories:
        `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `brew`, `choco`, `...`
        * You can also download precompiled binaries [here](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
        
        ##### 2. Install pcapgraph with pip
            pip install --user pcapgraph
        
        ### Installation Errors
        *These are some misconfiguration errors I came across during testing on Ubuntu.
         If you have trouble installing, please create an issue.*
        #### _tkinter not installed
        * On ubuntu, you may need to install the `python3.6-tk` package to 
        use the tkinter parts of matplotlib.
        
        #### ImportError: cannot import name 'multiarray'
        If you have versions of numpy or matplotlib that were installed with a 
        non-3.6 version of python, you may need to reinstall both.
        
            python3.6 -m pip uninstall -y numpy matplotlib
            python3.6 -m pip install --user numpy matplotlib
        
        ## Examples
        You can generate the image above with the following commands:
        
        examples/*.pcap were generated with 
        
            pcapgraph --generate
        
        pcap_graph.png was generated with 
        
            pcapgraph -c --format png --dir .
        
        pcap_graph.txt was generated with 
        
            pcapgraph -c --format txt --dir .
