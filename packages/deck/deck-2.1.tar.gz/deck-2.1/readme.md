Deck
====

Deck is an implementation of the `deck` collection type, commonly confused with [`collections.deque`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque).

```python
>>> from deck import Deck
>>> d = Deck()
>>> d.shuffle()
>>> d.deal()
Card(<Suit.Diamonds: '♦'>, <Value.Two: 2>)
>>> d.deal()
Card(<Suit.Diamonds: '♦'>, <Value.Three: 3>)
>>> d.deal()
Card(<Suit.Hearts: '♥'>, <Value.Ten: 10>)
>>> d.deal()
Card(<Suit.Diamonds: '♦'>, <Value.Nine: 9>)
```

Deck supports cheating, if that's how you want to play.

```python
>>> d.deal_from_bottom()
Card(<Suit.Spades: '♠'>, <Value.Five: 5>)
```

Importing the `deck` module also globally corrects other typographical errors that may occur in your code.

```python
>>> import deck
>>> from collections import deck
>>> deck
<class 'deck.Deck'>
```
