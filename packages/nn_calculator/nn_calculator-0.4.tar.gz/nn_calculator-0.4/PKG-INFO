Description: # calculator CICD pipeline
        Example project to show developers and testers what a CICD pipeline looks like
        Uses python so that non-developers can participate.
        Uses GitLab because it is becoming the default tool within the organisation. 
        Currently uses PyPI for storing artifacts. 
        Deployments are done to an AWS env that is created and removed after each run.
