It supports learning statistical dependencies for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships,
where each one corresponds to

- mutual information (MI) estimation,
- feature selection, and
- graphical model structure learning,

respectively. Specifically, depynd supports MI estimation for discrete-continuous mixtures, MI-based feature
selection, and structure learning of undirected graphical models (a.k.a. Markov random fields)."""
