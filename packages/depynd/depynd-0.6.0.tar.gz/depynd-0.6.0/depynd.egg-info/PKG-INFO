Description: depynd is a Python library for evaluating dependencies among random variables from data.
        It supports learning statistical dependencies for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships,
        where each one corresponds to
        
        - mutual information (MI) estimation,
        - feature selection, and
        - graphical model structure learning,
        
        respectively. Specifically, depynd supports MI estimation for discrete-continuous mixtures, MI-based feature
        selection, and structure learning of undirected graphical models (a.k.a. Markov random fields).
