# tribology
This Python 3 package is a collection of functions and classes for
tribology research and education, including contact mechanics,
lubrication science and data handling. It provides implementations of
analytical and numerical calculation routines together with frequently
used constants.

The **tribology package** is hosted on GitHub:

    https://github.com/moritzploss/tribology

You can also **install** the package from the
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tribology" target="_blank">PyPI</a>
index using pip:

Neutral builds are continuously deployed to PyPI. The log for
neutral builds includes changes with respect to the latest numbered
release listed below.

#### latest neutral build
- README.md updated
- refactoring


#### 0.3.0
- `p3can` source code now fully merged with tribology package


#### 0.2.94

- module `roller_bearings` added
- function `fcylrolbear` added to module `roller_bearings`
- function `kinaxthrustrolbear` added to module `roller_bearings`
- added function `approx_hertz_rad` to module `hertz`
- merged <a href="https://github.com/moritzploss/p3can" target="_blank">
P3CAN project</a> with tribology package. The tribology package now has
a module `p3can` that allows users to run P3CAN simulation runs. The
final aim is to split the P3CAN code into standalone functions and
integrate them with the tribology package.
- refactoring


#### 0.2.58

- DOI now indexed through Zenodo
- method `walther` now supports `ndarray` arguments
- method `profrolleriso` added to `tribology` module
- no longer compatible with Python 3.4 and lower
- the `data_import` module now provides functions to import output files
from PCS Instruments test rigs.
- module `data_import` added. the module contains functions for data
import from delimited data files into Numpy and Matlab database format.
- modules renamed, removed leading `tribology_` in module names
- auto-release on PyPI through Travis CI
- refactoring


#### 0.2.2

- html documentation now with multi-page structure
- docstrings changed to numpy format and refactored
- functions `eeff` and `reff` moved to `tribology_hertz` module
- function `eeff` renamed to `reff`

- helper functions made private


#### 0.2.1
- Sphinx documentation added to GitHub repo, docs available at
https://moritzploss.github.io/tribology
