=============================================
actingweb - an ActingWeb Python Library
=============================================
This is a python library implementing the REST-based `ActingWeb <http://actingweb.org>`_
distributed micro-services model. It serves as the reference implementation for the ActingWeb REST
protocol specification for how such micro-services interact. In order to follow the specification, an
application needs to implement a set of API endpoints. These can be implemented using any REST framework
(or just plain http requests). See `ActingWeb <http://actingweb.org>`_ for example/boilerplate project(s).
