        --------------------
        
        send slack music notifications from itunes or spotify
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        - OS X
        - iTunes or Spotify
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using PIP via PyPI::
        
            pip install slack-tunes
        
        Using PIP via Github::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/josegonzalez/python-slack-tunes.git#egg=slack-tunes
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Export a ``SLACK_API_TOKEN``, as shown on their `tokens page <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/215770388-Create-and-regenerate-API-tokens>`_, and then execute the binary:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            export SLACK_API_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"
            slack-tunes
        
        Slack tunes will run in the foreground, and can be terminated at any time. It will update the status at most every 10 seconds, and will clear your status if no music is playing.
        
        
        You can also specify multiple tokens via comma-delimiter. This is useful for notifying multiple slack teams.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            export SLACK_API_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN,YOUR_OTHER_TOKEN"
