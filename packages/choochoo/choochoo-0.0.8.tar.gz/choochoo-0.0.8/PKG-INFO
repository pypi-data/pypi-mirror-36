        # choochoo (ch2)
        
        An **open**, **hackable** and **free** training diary.
        
        I wrote this mainly for myself, but perhaps it will also be attractive to 
        others who want a way to track and plan their progress that is open, 
        lightweight and extensible.
        
        The main interface is a curses-style diary, used to track daily activity
        as well as progress towards aims.  A flexible "schedule spec" is used to
        define periodic events (eg training routines) and (unfortunately) there's 
        dedicated fuctionality for tracking injuries.
