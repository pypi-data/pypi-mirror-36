##  trimarlib-brio

**Basic Remote Input/Output** - Python application

###  Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See [Deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

####  Prerequisites

The build process requires some basic development tools:

* `make` - GNU Make program, either for *nix or Windows system, used to execute build and test targets
* `git` - used not only to clone the repository, but also in auto-versioning (see [Versioning](#versioning))
* `python3`

Two standard Python packages are used for build and installation steps:

* `setuptools`
* `wheel`

The application depends on the following libraries:

 - `trimarlib-sysfsgpio`
 - `trimarlib-newland`
 - `json-rpc`

These dependencies are defined in the `setup.py` installation script and therefore should be
automatically satisfied by `pip`.

####  Building and releasing

Invoking `make all` (default target) prepares archives for distribution. It is done in two steps:

1. query Git repository for tags (`git describe` command) to determine current version and generate 
`version.py` file,
2. invoke Python interpreter passing `setup.py` script to prepare source and wheel distributions.

The Python interpreter invoked by the `Makefile` defaults to `python` - it is possible to override it 
passing a `PYTHON` variable to the command, e.g. `make all PYTHON=python3`.

The release process is automated and based on GitLab CI/CD environment - each commit triggers a build job
which attempts to make and install built packages. If the commit is tagged, the built wheel distribution
is passed to the deployment stage and the runner attempts to upload the package to the repository 
specified in project settings.

###  Deployment

Installation via `pip` (i.e. `pip install trimarlib-brio`) is the recommended method of deployment.

After the package has been installed it is recommended to perform additional steps:

1. Install `gpio-exporter.service` and `gpio.rules` - see
[`sysfsgpiolib` project](https://dsl2.trimar.org/pythons-ll/sysfsgpiolib) for more information;
2. Install `brio.service` and `brio.ini` configuration file.

The second step is performed using the entry points exposed by the package:

* `brio-install-service` - copies the predefined service file to `/etc/systemd/system/brio.service`, reloads
`systemd` daemons and enables the service. Run `brio-install-service -h` for more information;
* `brio-install-configuration` - copies the default configuration file to the default location.
Run `brio-install-configuration -h` for more information.
* `brio-install` - performs the above steps in one go. Run `brio-install -h` for more information.

The application is started using another entry point - `brio-app`. Run `brio-app -h` for more information.

###  Versioning

The project is versioned using a simple pattern based on repository tagging feature. See [Makefile](Makefile)
for implementation details, for versions available see 
[tags on this repository](https://dsl2.trimar.org/pythons-ll/brio/tags).

###  Usage

See docstrings for API documentation.

Example of using the server in a custom application:

```python
from brio import Server
import time


server = Server()
server.configure()
server.start()
time.sleep(10)
server.stop()
```

The application is run using the `brio-app` entry point, see [Deployment](#deployment) for more information.
