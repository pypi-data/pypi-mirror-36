Description: =====
        Screener
        =====
        
        Screener is a simple Django REST app to manage phone screening. For each
        screen, users add questions and candidates.
        
        
        Requires
        --------
        Django REST framework
        
        PyPI download
        -------------
        pip install django-screener
        
        
        Important Info
        --------------
        Requires a valid token to access the API. Your site must provide its own login functionality.
        You can use the django-rest-auth package to handle token authentication for you.
        https://django-rest-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
        
        If you want to browse the API in the browser, a valid session will be required. You can uncomment the default session login
        provided by the Django Rest Framework in the project root urls.py for this if you do not have session login 
        functionality. Documentation for this can be found below.
        http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/4-authentication-and-permissions/#adding-login-to-the-browsable-api
        
        This is just an API. Grab the client side code from this repo https://github.com/richardleahy/ng-screener
        
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "screener and the Django REST framework" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'rest_framework',
                'screener.apps.ScreenerConfig',
            ]
        
        2. Include the screener URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            url(r'^screener/', include('screener.urls')),
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the screener models.
        
        4. Start the development server (python manage.py runserver)
        
        5. Grab the GUI from this repo https://github.com/richardleahy/ng-screener
           
        5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/screener/ to view the API. Need to add url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls')),
           to your root urls.py to be able to login if you do not already have login functionality.
        
        6. Add some questions.
        
        7. Add some screens.
        
        8. Create candidates and add them to screens
        
        9. Start phone screening!
