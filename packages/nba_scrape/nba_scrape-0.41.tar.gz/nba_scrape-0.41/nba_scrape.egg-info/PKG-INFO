        1) Compile a list of all NBA players and their IDs when initializing the NBA class.
        
        2) Easily load all regular season and playoff stats off a player's career page to a SQLite database. Only the player's name is required as input.
        
        3) Retrieve all traditional stats and select advanced ones (such as True Shooting Percentage) via database queries; only the requested stats and seasons are required as input.
        
        4) Browser-agnostic; uses the best available browser or raises an error if no supported browser is available.
        
        5) Test suite to ensure correct statistics are returned.
