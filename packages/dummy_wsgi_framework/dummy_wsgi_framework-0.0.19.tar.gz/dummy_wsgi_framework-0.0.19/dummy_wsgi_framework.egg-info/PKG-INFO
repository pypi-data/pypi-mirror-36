        Common description
        ==================
        
        **Dummy WSGI Framework** is base for your Web-applications or your own WSGI-framework.
        It is "unpretentious" and "dummy" (although in fact it is not so "simple" and "stupid" as it may seem at first glance). It was build as *Just4Fun*-project.
        
        **Dummy WSGI Framework** methodology contain "controllers" and "views", as pattern "Model-View-Controller" without "Model".
        
        It allows you to work with views generated within controllers or loaded from files, for example, in the basic version of the framework it is just HTML-files.
        
        **Dummy WSGI Framework** is potentially expanding:
        
        * due to open access to the WSGI-interface at the level of application controllers, developed on its (framework) basis;
        * due to the possibility of using arbitrary template engines due to the function of loading view files implemented in the core of the decorator framework;
        * and, in the end, it's Python, there's a lot possible.
        
        You are free to use **Dummy WSGI Framework** as a framework for your Web applications or as a basis for your Web framework. It is not necessary to refer to the fact that You use **Dummy WSGI Framework**, but I would like to have a public review, even if it is not positive.
