        --------------
        
        ``django-budget`` is a Django and JavaScript app that can track stories
        as they are conceived, assembled and published.
        
        It includes an approachable interface that can handle all the daily
        demands of planning and assembling content across news organizations
        large and small, based on a standards-compliant API that can be used by
        other consumers â€” from chatbots to full-screen displays to many other
        applications.
        
        Detailed documentation (including a user guide) will be added at a later
        date.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        #. Install this app into a Django project and virtual environment (more
           information about reaching this stage will also be forthcoming):
        
           ::
        
                pip install django-budget
        
        #. Add "budget" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:
        
           ::
        
               INSTALLED_APPS = [
                   ...
                   'budget',
               ]
        
        #. Include the budget URLconf in your project urls.py like this:
        
           ::
        
               url(r'^budget/', include('budget.urls')),
        
        #. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the budget models.
        
        #. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/budget/
           to see your story budget and begin planning stories.
        
        #. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/budget/api/ to explore the app's REST
           API.
