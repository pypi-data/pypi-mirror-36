WiX.Py


Cross-platform JSON-driven MSI package builder. Unlike a bunch of WiX/wixl wrappers
(python-wix, go-msi, msi-packager etc.) WiX.Py is a standalone application.
It uses libmsi on UNIX platforms and msi.dll on MS Windows.

Application has been designed for build toolchains under Docker environment,
i.e. it doesn't depend on windowing system or networking features. Thus it allows
building MSI packages in CI services without dedicated MSW cloud instance.
This one decreases project infrastructure cost and speed-ups builds.

Unlike WiX/wixl we don't propose users to use complex WXS file format and
understanding MSI internal features. To build MSI package for your app you need
creating just a small JSON file of 20-40 lines with description of MSI package
features (application name, manufacturer, keywords etc.). No any magic or
special knowledge.

We have designed WiX.Py first of all to build installers for small and medium
size desktop applications. If you need complex enterprise features for your
installer you may use WiX.

Brief visual guide how to use WiX.Py is on the main page of
project website: https://wix.sk1project.net
