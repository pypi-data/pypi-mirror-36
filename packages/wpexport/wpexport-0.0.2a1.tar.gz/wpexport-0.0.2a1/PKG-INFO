Description: # wpexport
        This small python package backup your Wordpress post to GitHub. It convert
        the html to Markdown with pypandoc. For the api interaction, I uses the two
        packages gitpython and python-wordpress-xmlrpc. So you have to install this
        dependence, if you wand to install it from source.
        
        ## quick start
        Install wpexport:
        ```bash
        pip install wpexport
        ```
        It uses pandoc for the formatting. you may have to install it manually.
        ```bash
        sudo apt install pandoc
        ```
        More information https://pandoc.org/installing.html
        
        Set up your settings:
        ```bash
        python -m wpexport --setup
        ```
        and when you have to input all the parameters. After that it will save the
        parameters in the file ~.wpexport.conf. Notice that your passwords are in this
        file.
        
        Now you are ready to have some fun.
        ```bash
        python -m wpexport
        ```
        
        ## command line arguments
        This command export all your post to the GitHub repo. If you didn't like the
        config file, you can pass the parameter throw the terminal. Use the name of the
        parameter as the command option. The command option will always override the
        config file. For axample you cann uses the config file for all parametes exclude
        the password. And then pass the password throw the command line.
        ```bash
        python -m wpexport --wp_pw 1234
        ```
        
        ## the config file
        You can also uses another config file. For the setup as well as the backup
        function.
        ```bash
        python -m wpexport --config "/path/to/your/config.json"
        ```
        The config file is a basic json file. You can look into it and change the
        values, if you like.
        
        ## only local export
        If you didn't like GitHub, only export it to your local machine.
        ```bash
        python -m wpexport --output "/path/to/your/export"
        ```
