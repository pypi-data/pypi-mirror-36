''' This is a child class of the MQTT client in the paho library.

.. Reviewed 29May2018.

It includes the management of reconnection when using only the loop() method
(which is not included natively in the paho library).


Notes on MQTT behaviour:

- if not connected, the `loop` and `publish` methods will not do anything,
  but raise no errors either.
- the `loop` method handles always only one message per call.

        There is the possibility of a race condition when testing the connection state too soon

        fast enough and the main loop tests the connection state before that call-back has set the
        state to ``connected``.  As a consequence the automatic reconnection feature gets triggered
