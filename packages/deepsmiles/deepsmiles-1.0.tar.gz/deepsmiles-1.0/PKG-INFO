Description: DeepSMILES
        ==========
        
        This Python module can convert well-formed SMILES (that is, as writen by a cheminformatics toolkit) to DeepSMILES. It also does the reverse conversion.
        
        DeepSMILES is a SMILES-like syntax suited to machine learning. Rings are indicated using a single symbol instead of two, while branches do not use matching parentheses but rather use a right parenthesis as a 'pop' operator.
        
        For example, benzene is `c1ccccc1` in SMILES but `cccccc6` in DeepSMILES (where the `6` indicates the ring size). As a branch example, the SMILES `C(Br)(OC)I` can be converted to the DeepSMILES `CBr)OC))I`. For more information, please see the corresponding preprint.
        
        The library is used as follows::
        
                import deepsmiles
                print("DeepSMILES version: %s" % deepsmiles.__version__)
                converter = deepsmiles.Converter(rings=True, branches=True)
                print(converter) # record the options used
        
                encoded = converter.encode("c1cccc(C(=O)Cl)c1")
                print("Encoded: %s" % encoded)
        
                try:
                    decoded = converter.decode(encoded)
                except deepsmiles.DecodeError as e:
                    decoded = None
                    print("DecodeError! Error message was '%s'" % e.message)
        
                if decoded:
                    print("Decoded: %s" % decoded)
