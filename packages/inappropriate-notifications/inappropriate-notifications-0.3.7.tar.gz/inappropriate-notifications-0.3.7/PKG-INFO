        Caveats (To fix / to-do)
        ------------------------
        
        -  Only tested on Debian+Gnome and (at some point) Windows 10 (MacOS and Windows 7 on roadmap)
        -  Relies on libnotify on Linux
        -  Icons are for Mac apps when on windows
        -  No fields on notifications (reply, dismiss) where applicable
        -  Does not pull names/images from people you know when applicable
        -  Only suited to work env -- students don't need messages about getting
           fired
        -  No tests
        -  No version command line argument
        -  ctrl-c when running command line should fail nicer
        -  Right-to-left names mess up first line
