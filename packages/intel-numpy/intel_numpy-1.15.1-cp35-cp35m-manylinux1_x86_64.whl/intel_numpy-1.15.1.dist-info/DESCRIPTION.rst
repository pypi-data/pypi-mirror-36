Optimized implementation of [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), leveraging Intel速 Math Kernel Library to achieve highly efficient multi-threading, vectorization, and memory management. Accelerates numpy's linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number generation capabilities, as well as select universal functions. Drop-in replacement that maintains Python and C API compatibility with numpy. Additional details can be found in our [SciPy 2017 conference proceedings](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2017/pdfs/oleksandr_pavlyk.pdf).

One of many Intel速 accelerated Python packages and performance library runtimes available on [PyPI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/installing-the-intel-distribution-for-python-and-intel-performance-libraries-with-pip-and), and as part of [Intel速 Distribution for Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python).
