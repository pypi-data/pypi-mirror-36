English uses spacing and hyphenation as cues to allow for beautiful and legible
line breaks. Certain CJK languages have none of these, and are notoriously more
difficult. Breaks occur randomly, usually in the middle of a word. This is a
long standing issue in typography on the web, and results in degradation of
readability.

Budou automatically translates CJK sentences into organized HTML code with
lexical chunks wrapped in non-breaking markup so as to semantically control line
breaks. Budou uses word segmenter to analyze the input sentence, and it
concatenates proper words in order to produce meaningful chunks utilizing
part-of-speech (pos) tagging and syntactic information. Processed chunks are
wrapped with :code:`SPAN` tag, so semantic units will no longer be split at
the end of a line by specifying their :code:`display` property as
:code:`inline-block` in CSS.


Installation
--------------

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can install it
with pip:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pip install budou


How to use
--------------

Budou outputs a HTML snippet wrapping chunks with :code:`span` tags like below.

.. code-block:: html

   <span><span class="ww">常に</span><span class="ww">最新、</span>
   <span class="ww">最高の</span><span class="ww">モバイル。</span></span>

Semantic chunks in the output HTML will not be split at the end of line by
conditioning each :code:`span` tag with :code:`display: inline-block` in CSS.

.. code-block:: css

   .ww {
     display: inline-block;
   }

By using the output HTML from Budou and above CSS conditioning, the sentence
on your webpage will be rendered with legible line breaks like shown below.

Using as a command-line app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can process your texts by running :code:`budou` command like below.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ budou 渋谷のカレーを食べに行く。

The output is:

.. code-block:: html

   <span><span class="ww">渋谷の</span><span class="ww">カレーを</span>
   <span class="ww">食べに</span><span class="ww">行く。</span></span>

You can also configure the command with optional parameters.
For example, you can change the backend segmenter to `MeCab <#mecab-segmenter>`_ and change the
class name to :code:`wordwrap` by running the command below.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ budou 渋谷のカレーを食べに行く。 --segmenter=mecab --classname=wordwrap

The output is:

.. code-block:: html

   <span><span class="wordwrap">渋谷の</span><span class="wordwrap">カレーを</span>
   <span class="wordwrap">食べに</span><span class="wordwrap">行く。</span></span>

Run help command :code:`budou -h` to see other available options.


Using programmatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use :code:`budou.parse` method in your python scripts.

.. code-block:: python

   import budou
   results = budou.parse('渋谷のカレーを食べに行く。')
   print(results['html_code'])
   # <span><span class="ww">渋谷の</span><span class="ww">カレーを</span>
   # <span class="ww">食べに</span><span class="ww">行く。</span></span>


You can also make a parser instance to reuse the segmenter backend with the same
configuration. If you want to integrate Budou into your web development
framework in a form of a custom filter or a build process, this would be the way
to go.

.. code-block:: python

   import budou
   parser = budou.get_parser('mecab')
   results = parser.parse('渋谷のカレーを食べに行く。')
   print(results['html_code'])
   # <span><span class="ww">渋谷の</span><span class="ww">カレーを</span>
   # <span class="ww">食べに</span><span class="ww">行く。</span></span>

   for chunk in results['chunks']:
     print(chunk.word)
   # 渋谷の 名詞
   # カレーを 名詞
   # 食べに 動詞
   # 行く。 動詞


(deprecated) :code:`authenticate` method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:code:`authenticate`, which have been the method to create a parser in the
previous releases, is now deprecated from this release.
:code:`authenticate` method is now a wrapper of :code:`get_parser` method and
returns a parser with
`Google Cloud Natural Language API <#google-cloud-natural-language-api-segmenter>`_
segmenter backend.
The method is still available, but it may be removed in a future release.

.. code-block:: python

   import budou
   parser = budou.authenticate('/path/to/credentials.json')

   # This is equivalent to:
   parser = budou.get_parser(
       'nlapi', credentials_path='/path/to/credentials.json')


Available backend segmenters
------------------------------

You can choose the backend segmenter considering your environmental needs.
Currently, the segmenters below are supported.

.. csv-table::
  :header: Name, Identifier, Supported Languages

  `Google Cloud Natural Language API <#google-cloud-natural-language-api-segmenter>`_, nlapi, "Chinese, Japanese, Korean"
  `MeCab <#mecab-segmenter>`_, mecab, "Japanese"
  `TinySegmenter <#tinysegmenter-based-segmenter>`_, tinysegmenter, "Japanese"


Specify the segmenter when you run :code:`budou` command or load a parser.
For example, you can run :code:`budou` command with MeCab segmenter by passing
:code:`--segmenter=mecab` parameter like below.

.. code-block:: sh

  $ budou 今日も元気です --segmenter=mecab

You can pass :code:`segmenter` parameter when you load a parser otherwise.

.. code-block:: python

  import budou
  parser = budou.get_parser('mecab')
  parser.parse('今日も元気です')

If no segmenter is specified, Google Cloud Natural Language API is used as the
default segmenter.


.. _nlapi-segmenter:

Google Cloud Natural Language API Segmenter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Google Cloud Natural Language API (https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)
(NL API) analyzes the input sentence using
machine learning technology. The API can extract not only syntax but also
entities included in the sentence, which can be used for better quality
segmentation (see more at `Entity mode <#entity-mode>`_). Since this is a simple
REST API, you don't need to maintain the dictionary and can support multiple
languages with one single source.

Supported languages
++++++++++++++++++++++

- Simplified Chinese (zh)
- Traditional Chinese (zh-Hant)
- Japanese (ja)
- Korean (ko)

For those considering to use Budou for Korean sentences, please also refer to
`Korean support <#korean-support>`_ section.


Authentication
+++++++++++++++

NL API requires authentication to use. Firstly, create a Google Cloud Platform
project and enable Cloud Natural Language API. Billing also need to be enabled
for the project. Then, download a credentials file for a service account by
accessing `Google Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.google.com/>`_
and navigating through "API & Services" > "Credentials" > "Create credentials" >
"Service account key" > "JSON".

Budou will handle authentication once the path to the credentials file is set
as :code:`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='/path/to/credentials.json'

You can also pass the path to the credentials file when you initialize the
parser.

.. code-block:: python

   parser = budou.get_parser(
       'nlapi', credentials_path='/path/to/credentials.json')

NL API segmenter uses *Syntax Analysis* and incurs cost according to monthly
usage. NL API has free quota to start testing the feature at free of cost.
Please refer to https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/pricing for more
detailed pricing information.

Caching system
++++++++++++++++

Parsers on NL API segmenter cache responses from the API in order to save
unnecessary requests to the API and make the processing faster. If you want to
force refresh the cache, set :code:`use_cache` as :code:`False`.

.. code-block:: python

   parser = budou.parse('明日は晴れるかな', segmenter='nlapi', use_cache=False)

In `Google App Engine Python 2.7 Standard Environment <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/>`_,
Budou tries to use
`memcache <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/memcache/>`_
service in order to cache the outputs efficiently across instances.
If not, Budou creates a cache file in
`python pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_ format in
your file system.


.. _entity-mode:

Entity mode
++++++++++++++++++

Default parser only uses results from Syntactic Analysis for parsing, but you
can also utilize results from *Entity Analysis* by specifying `use_entity=True`.
Entity Analysis will improve the accuracy of parsing for some phrases,
especially proper nouns, so it is recommended to use if your target sentences
include a name of an individual person, place, organization etc.

Please note that Entity Analysis will results in additional pricing because it
requires additional requests to NL API. For more detail about API pricing,
please refer to https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/pricing for more
detail.

.. code-block:: python

  import budou
  # Without Entity mode (default)
  result = budou.parse('六本木ヒルズでご飯を食べます。', use_entity=False)
  print(result['html_code'])
  # <span class="ww">六本木</span><span class="ww">ヒルズで</span>
  # <span class="ww">ご飯を</span><span class="ww">食べます。</span>

  # With Entity mode
  result = budou.parse('六本木ヒルズでご飯を食べます。', use_entity=True)
  print(result['html_code'])
  # <span class="ww">六本木ヒルズで</span>
  # <span class="ww">ご飯を</span><span class="ww">食べます。</span>


.. _mecab-segmenter:

MeCab Segmenter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MeCab (https://github.com/taku910/mecab) is an open source text segmentation
library for Japanese language. MeCab Segmenter does not require any billed API
calling unlike Google Cloud Natural Language API Segmenter, so you can process
the sentences without internet connection free. You can also customize the
dictionary by building your own.

Supported languages
++++++++++++++++++++++

- Japanese

Installation
+++++++++++++++++

You need to have MeCab installed to use MeCab segmenter in Budou.
You can install MeCab with IPA dictionary by running

.. code-block:: sh

   $ make install-mecab

in the project's home directory after cloning this repository.


.. _tinysegmenter-based-segmenter:

TinySegmenter-based Segmenter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TinySegmenter (http://chasen.org/~taku/software/TinySegmenter/) is a compact
Japanese tokenizer originally created by (c) 2008 Taku Kudo.
This tokenizes sentences by a combination of pattern matchings carefully
designed using machine learning. It means **you can use this backend without
any additional setup!**

Supported languages
++++++++++++++++++++++

- Japanese


.. _korean:

Korean support
-------------------

Korean has spaces between chunks, so you can organize line breaking simply by
putting `word-break: keep-all` in your CSS. We recommend you to use that
technique instead of using Budou.


Where to use
---------------

Budou is designed to be used mostly in eye-catching sentences such as titles
and headings assuming split chunks would be more stood out negatively in larger
typography.


Accessibility
-------------------

Some screen reader software read wrapped chunks one by one when Budou is
applied, which may degrades user experience for those who need audio support.
You can attach any attribute to the output chunks to enhance accessibility.
For example, you can make screen readers to read undivided sentences by
combining `aria-describedby` and `aria-label` attribute in the output.

.. code-block:: html

  <p id="description" aria-label="やりたいことのそばにいる">
    <span class="ww" aria-describedby="description">やりたい</span>
    <span class="ww" aria-describedby="description">ことの</span>
    <span class="ww" aria-describedby="description">そばに</span>
    <span class="ww" aria-describedby="description">いる</span>
  </p>

**This functionality is currently down** due to html5lib sanitizer's behavior
which strips aria related attributes from the output HTML. The progress on this
issue is tracked at https://github.com/google/budou/issues/74
