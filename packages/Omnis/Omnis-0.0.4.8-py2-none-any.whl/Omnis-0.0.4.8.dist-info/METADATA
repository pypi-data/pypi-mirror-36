# Omnis
Deep Learning for Everyone

------------------


## You have just found Omnis.

Omnis is an API of deep neural network applications, written in Python and capable of running on top of [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast application of deep learning.

Use Omnis if you need a deep learning library that:

- Is EASY to learn and use.
- Allows for easy and fast prototyping.
- Supports CNN, LSTM, GAN, RL application.(TBA)
- Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

Omnis is compatible with: __Python 2.7-3.6__.

------------------


## Guiding principles

- __Simplicity.__ Omnis pursues a simple architecture. Designing a software with simple architecture not only helps you to understand the code easily but also helps your painful debugging.

- __Easiness.__ Don't worry about complicated algorithms or theories or mathematics. Omnis will handle difficult stuffs for you. Just learn how to use deep neural networks and USE THIS!

- __Modularity.__ No spaghetti code!

------------------


## Installation

Before installing Omnis, please install Keras. We recommend the TensorFlow backend for Keras.

Then, you can install Omnis itself. There are two ways to install Omnis:

- **Install Omnis from PyPI (recommended):**

If you don't use a virtual environment, you can run the command below (not recommended):

```sh
sudo pip install omnis
```

If you are using a virtual environment, you may want to avoid using sudo (conda virtual environment recommended):

```sh
pip install omnis
```

- **Alternatively: install Omnis from the GitHub source:**

First, clone Omnis using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mkh48v/omnis.git
```

 Then, `cd` to the Omnis folder and run the install command:
```sh
cd omnis
sudo python setup.py install
```

------------------


## Why this name, Omnis?

Omnis means _EVERY_ in Latin. The goal of Omnis is to make deep learning technologies easier so that _EVERY_ one can use deep learning technologies without headache.
