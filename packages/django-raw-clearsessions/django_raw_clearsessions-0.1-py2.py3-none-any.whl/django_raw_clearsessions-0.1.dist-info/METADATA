django-raw-clearsessions
========================

By default, Djangoâ€™s ``cached_db`` and ``db`` session backends loop
through deleted sessions in order to trigger pre/post delete signal
handlers. This can be *extremely* slow and consume *a lot* of CPU and
memory on sites with a lot of sessions.

This package provides a ``SessionStoreMixin`` class and alternative
``cached_db`` and ``db`` backends that use the private ``_raw_delete()``
method, which is much faster and consumes much less CPU and memory, but
does not trigger pre/post delete signal handlers.

Usage
-----

Add to your settings:

::

    SESSION_ENGINE = 'django_raw_clearsessions.cached_db'

Or:

::

    SESSION_ENGINE = 'django_raw_clearsessions.db'

Or:

::

    # mybackend.py
    from some.package import some_backend
    from django_raw_clearsessions import SessionStoreMixin


    class SessionStore(SessionStoreMixin, some_backend.SessionStore):
        pass

    # settings.py
    SESSION_ENGINE = 'mybackend'

Execute the Django ``clearsessions`` management command:

::

    $ python manage.py clearsessions
