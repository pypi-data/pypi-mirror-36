# Simple program to connect to servers from a list.

[![Travis CI Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-link]

This is a simple program to load servers from a file, list them, then allow you to login, SSH mount, etc.

Features provided by a terse command line syntax:

* Login using a terminal instance on the command line via SSH.
* Invoke an xterm on a configured host.
* Mount and unmount a [SSH Fuse] directory.
* Invoke a [Emacs] session via SSH.
* Print environment in a [bash] `export` format for scripting.
* Output a bourne shell script that does what the script would do for a
  particular environment (per `-n` option).

Other commands are easily configurable in [cli.py].


## Obtaining

The easist way to install the command line program is via the `pip` installer:
```bash
pip install zensols.hostcon
```

Binaries are also available on [pypi].


## Usage

First, create a configuration file.  Examples used by the test cases are
given [here](test-resources).  Below is a simple example that declares an SSH
host `jove` on the (default) port 22 with [SSH Fuse] mount options convenient for
a MacOS client.

```ini
[default]
host_name=jove
ssh_port=22
ssh_switches=-X -Y
mount_options=reconnect,sshfs_sync,no_readahead,sync_read,cache=no,noreadahead,noubc,noappledouble,noapplexattr
```

Save this example to `~/.hostconrc` or anywhere else specified in environment
variable `HOSTCONRC`.  Now we can get include this as environment:

```bash
$ hostcon env
export DOMAIN=None
export HOST_NAME=jove
export SSH_PORT=22
export USER_NAME=someuser
```

Start an XTerm on the host:

```bash
$ hostcon
invoking ssh -X -Y -f -p 22 someuser@jove /usr/bin/xterm
```

See the [test cases](test/python/tests.py) for more examples of how to
configure and *alias* host information.


### Help

The usage is given with `-h`:

```sql
$ hostcon -h
Usage: hostcon <list|...> [options]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --short           short output for list
  -w NUMBER, --whine=NUMBER
                        add verbosity to logging
  -n HOST_NAME, --hostname=HOST_NAME
                        the host to connect to
  -d, --dryrun          dry run to not actually connect, but act like it
```
