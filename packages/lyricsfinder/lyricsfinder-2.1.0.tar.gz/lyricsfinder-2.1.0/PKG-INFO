Description: LyricsFinder
        ============
        
        LyricsFinder is a modular and easily expandable Python Package that is
        used to extract lyrics. By having the ability to use a
        combination of a Google Custom Search Engine and a set of extractors for
        several sources, lyrics are attained with much higher accuracy and
        generally from the best desired source.
