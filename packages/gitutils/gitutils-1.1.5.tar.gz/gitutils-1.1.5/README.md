# Git Utilities

Platform-independent (Linux/Mac/Windows) Git utilities, useful for managing large (100+) numbers of Git repos.
I use command-line `git` because PyGit also requires command-line Git installed, and I don't need the advanced functionality.

A very important feature in
```sh
ListAllGithubRepos
```
is showing which forks of your repos have had changes "ahead of" your code.
This shows your code is being improved, even if the forked repo didn't make a pull request.
I don't know of any other easy way out there to find this.

Git [utilities](https://github.com/scivision/gitedu) for managing large (100+) numbers of users / teams, particularly for education and institutions.

## Install

Install Git in a way accessible from the command line line

-   Mac: `brew install git`
-   Linux: `apt install git`
-   Windows: command line [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
-   BSD: `pkg install git`

```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```


## Usage

I didn't know of any other easy ways to do these Git tasks:

* `gitbranch` Tells of any non-master branches under directory ~/code
* `git_filemode_windows`  Sets all git repos to don't care permissions under directory ~/code
* `gitemail` list all contributor email addresses. Optionally, amend email addresses for prior Git commits

### Sync large number of git repos

These assume numerous subdirectories under `~/code` or `c:\code`. They
work very quickly for large numbers (100+) repos

* `gtps` check if any repos have pending changes
* `gtpl` Git pulls all repos
* `gtft` Git fetches all repos

You can place an empty file `.nogit` in a subdirectory to skip `pull` or `push`.


### Preview all changed Jekyll files

This is for a website made using
[Jekyll](https://www.scivision.co/create-jekyll-github-pages-website):
```sh
ActOnChanged -j
```

## Github
Python GitHub [API](https://pypi.org/project/PyGithub/)

### GitHub user stats

`ListAllGithubRepos`
Gives stats on GitHub repos for a particular user.
It requires extra prereqs via:
```sh
pip install -e .[github]
```
