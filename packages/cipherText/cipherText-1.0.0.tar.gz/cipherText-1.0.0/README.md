'Cipher' is a package which helps to encrypt and decrypt text(.txt) files. It uses the 4-key combination to encrypt and decrypt particular file. It creates a encrypted or decrypted file near the original file location. It has two functions 'Encryp()' and 'Decryp()'. They both exactly take 5 arguements - path of file, number(key) between 1-25, number(key) between 1-25, number(key) between 1-29, number(key) between 1-9. The key used for encryption is required to decrypt that particular file.
