# Welcome to surfinBH!

_**surfinBH**_ provides _**sur**rogate **fin**al **B**lack_ _**H**ole_
properties for mergers of binary black holes (BBH).

These fits are described in the following papers: <br/>
[1] Vijay Varma, Davide Gerosa, François Hébert, Leo C. Stein and Hao Zhang,
2018, in preparation.

If you find this package useful in your work, please cite reference [1] and,
if available, the relevant paper describing the particular model.

This package is compatible with both python2 and python3.
This package lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/vijayvarma392/surfinBH) and
is tested every day with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). You can see the
current build status of the master branch at the top of this page.

## Installation

### PyPI
_**surfinBH**_ is available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/surfinBH/).

## Usage

```python
import surfinBH
```

### See list of available fits
```python
print(surfinBH.fits_collection.keys())
>>> ['surfinBH3dq8', 'surfinBH7dq2']
```

Pick your favorite fit and get some basic information about it.
```python
fit_name = 'surfinBH7dq2'

surfinBH.fits_collection[fit_name].desc
>>> 'Fits for remnant mass, spin and kick veclocity for generically precessing BBH systems.'

surfinBH.fits_collection[fit_name].refs
>>> 'arxiv.2018.xxxx'
```

### Load the fit
This only needs to be done **once** at the start of your script.
```python
fit = surfinBH.LoadFits(fit_name)
>>> Loaded surfinBH7dq2 fit.
```
### Evaluation
The evaluation of each fit is different, so be sure to read the documentation.
This also describes the frames in which different quantities are defined.
```python
help(fit)
```

We also provide ipython examples for usage of different fits:

* [surfinBH3dq8](https://github.com/vijayvarma392/surfinBH/blob/master/examples/example_3dq8.ipynb)

* [surfinBH7dq2](https://github.com/vijayvarma392/surfinBH/blob/master/examples/example_7dq2.ipynb)
