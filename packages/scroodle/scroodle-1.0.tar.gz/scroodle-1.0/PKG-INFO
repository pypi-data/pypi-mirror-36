        Clone the git repository to your local machine.
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/tsehori/scroodle.git
        ```
        
        Then, install the dependencies from requirements.txt:

        ```
        
        To use the program, make sure that your current directory in the command line is *scroodle*, then:
        ```sh
        python main.py
        ```
        And just follow the program's instructions!
