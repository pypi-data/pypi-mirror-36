# The mpoints package

The `mpoints` package is a machine learning tool that implements the class of state-dependent Hawkes processes.
Its key features include both simulation and estimation (statistical inference).
It also contains a module with specialised plotting services.

State-dependent Hawkes processes belong to the class of hybrid marked point processes,
a class that models the arrival in time of random events and their interaction with the state of a system.

We strongly recommend to first read the tutorial.
It contains an introduction to this statistical model and illustrates the main services offered by the `mpoints` package.

For additional mathematical details, please consult the documentation and the references.

## Installation

The package can be easily installed via `pip`, a popular package management system for Python. In the terminal, simply enter the following command.

```
    pip install mpoints

If you are using virtual environments (with conda), make sure that you install the package in the intended environment.
