Description: Convert DICOM Files to PNG
        ===========================

        *Important Changes*
          - **8/26/2018** - Ability to apply auto-contrast to the converted images
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        A simple python module to make it easy to batch convert a binary DICOM file, which is usually an output from
        an MRI scan to a PNG image.
        
        The MRI scanning facilities typically hand you a CD containing your MRI scans. This CD will typically not contain
        any image files in traditional formats that can be opened up by your default image viewing program. The CD contains
        a list of DICOM files, which can only be viewed by the included viewer, which is mostly only supported on a Windows machine.
        
        This module should help you convert all the DICOM based scans to PNG files. This tool can be used as a command line tools as well as a library in your python code
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To have known to work dependencies use beforehand::
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        `mritopng` comes with a `setup.py` script to use with distutils. After unpacking the distribution, `cd` into the directory and execute the command::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        This will install two things
        
         * The `mritopng` module will be installed; `import mritopng` will allow you to use it
         * A command line utility called `mritopng` which can be used from the console
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        `mritopng` will install a command line utility that can be used to convert individual DICOM files or folders
        
        ### Getting Help
        
        ```
        $ mritopng --help
        usage: mritopng [-h] [-f] [-c] dicom_path png_path
        
        Convert a dicom MRI file to png. To conver a whole folder recursivly, use the
        -f option
        
        positional arguments:
          dicom_path           Full path to the mri file
          png_path             Full path to the generated png file
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help           show this help message and exit
          -f, --folder         Convert a whole folder instead of a single file
          -c, --auto-contrast  Apply contrast after converting default image
        ```
        
        ### Convert Single File
        
        ```sh
        # Converts the file /DICOM/SCAN1 to a file called output.png,
        # while applying auto contrast
        $ mritopng --auto-contrast /DICOM/SCAN1 output.png
        ```
        
        **Note:** If file `output.png` already exists, it will be overwritten
        
        ### Convert Folder Tree
        
        The utility can also be used to convert a whole folder recursively by using the `-f` option::
        
        ```sh
        # Takes all the files in /DICOM, converts the files to png and
        # puts them in the /PNG folder with the same structure as /DICOM. 
        $ mritopng -f /DICOM /PNG
        ```
        
        **Note:**
         - Existing top level folder will NOT be over-written e.g. the example above will fail of the folder `/PNG` already exists
         - The tool will try to convert as many files as it can, skipping the ones that it can't
        
        Using it as a Library
        ---------------------
        
        It's pretty easy to get up and running with `mritopng` in your own project
        
        ```py
        import mritopng
        
        # Convert a single file with auto-contrast
        mritopng.convert_file('/home/user/DICOM/SCAN1', '/home/user/output.png', auto_contrast=True)
        
        # Convert a whole folder recursively
        mritopng.convert_folder('/home/user/DICOM/', '/home/user/PNG/')
        ```
