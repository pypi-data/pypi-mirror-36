.SH EXAMPLES
.nf R
Open a JSON playlist:
.ft B
	comp -e json test/playlist.json

.ft R
Open a Youtube playlist with video height lower than 720:
.ft B
	comp -f '[height<720]' https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLnk14Iku8QM7R3ARnrj1TwYSZleF-i7jT
.SH BUGS
.PP
Media durations are not extracted from online playlists as youtube-dl
extract_flat option is used. This is rather a feature to save up bandwidth than
a bug because a track's duration is updated when it's played.
