Python bindings to Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library -- optimized building blocks for all data analytics stages, from data preparation to data mining & machine learning. Optimizes data ingestion and algorithmic compute together for the highest performance. Supports offline, streaming, and distributed usage models to meet a range of application needs. Highly tuned for efficient data layout, blocking, multi-threading, vectorization -- 
helping applications deliver better predictions faster, and enabling analysis of larger data sets with the same compute resources. 

One of many Intel® accelerated Python packages and performance library runtimes available on [PyPI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/installing-the-intel-distribution-for-python-and-intel-performance-libraries-with-pip-and), and as part of [Intel® Distribution for Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python).
