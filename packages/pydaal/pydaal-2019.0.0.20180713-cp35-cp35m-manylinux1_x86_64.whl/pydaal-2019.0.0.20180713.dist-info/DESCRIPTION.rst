Python bindings to Intel速 Data Analytics Acceleration Library -- optimized building blocks for all data analytics stages, from data preparation to data mining & machine learning. Optimizes data ingestion and algorithmic compute together for the highest performance. Supports offline, streaming, and distributed usage models to meet a range of application needs. Highly tuned for efficient data layout, blocking, multi-threading, vectorization -- 
helping applications deliver better predictions faster, and enabling analysis of larger data sets with the same compute resources. 

One of many Intel速 accelerated Python packages and performance library runtimes available on [PyPI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/installing-the-intel-distribution-for-python-and-intel-performance-libraries-with-pip-and), and as part of [Intel速 Distribution for Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/distribution-for-python).
