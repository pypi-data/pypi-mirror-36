Original protocol hacking by MattTW : https://github.com/MattTW/BlinkMonitorProtocol

API calls faster than 60 seconds is not recommended as it can overwhelm Blink's servers.  Please use this module responsibly.

Installation
================
``pip3 install blinkpy``

Installing Development Version
==================================
To install the current development version, perform the following steps.  Note that the following will create a blinkpy directory in your home area:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/fronzbot/blinkpy.git
    $ cd blinkpy
    $ rm -rf build dist
    $ python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
    $ pip3 install --upgrade dist/*.whl


Purpose
===========
This library was built with the intention of allowing easy communication with Blink camera systems, specifically so I can add a module into homeassistant https://home-assistant.io

Usage
=========
The simplest way to use this package from a terminal is to call ``Blink.start()`` which will prompt for your Blink username and password and then log you in.  Alternatively, you can instantiate the Blink class with a username and password, and call ``Blink.start()`` to login and setup without prompt, as shown below.

.. code:: python

    import blinkpy
    blink = blinkpy.Blink(username='YOUR USER NAME', password='YOUR PASSWORD')
    blink.start()

If you would like to log in without setting up the cameras or system, you can simply call the ``Blink.login()`` function which will prompt for a username and password and then authenticate with the server.  This is useful if you want to avoid use of the ``start()`` function which simply acts as a wrapper for more targeted API methods.

The cameras are of a BlinkCamera class, of which the following parameters can be used (the code below creates a Blink object and iterates through each camera found)

.. code:: python

    import blinkpy

    blink = blinkpy.Blink(username='YOUR USER NAME', password='YOUR PASSWORD')
    blink.start()

    for name, camera in blink.cameras.items():
        print(name)                  # Name of the camera
        print(camera.attributes)      # Print available attributes of camera
