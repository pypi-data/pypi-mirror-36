"""
Define Bodhi's WSGI application.

As of the writing of this docblock, this module is a bit misnamed since the webapp is actually
defined in bodhi.server.__init__. However, that is an anti-pattern with lots of nasty in-line
imports due to circular dependencies, and this module is intended to solve that problem.
Unfortunately, it is a backwards-incompatible change to move main() here, so it will remain in
__init__ until we make a major Bodhi release. See https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/2294
