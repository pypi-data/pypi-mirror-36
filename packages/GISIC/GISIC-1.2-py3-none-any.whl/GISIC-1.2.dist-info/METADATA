Gaussian Inflection Spline Interpolation Continuum
GISIC

Author: Devin D. Whitten

Date: February 18, 2018

This package performs normalization of astronomical spectra based on a continuum identification routine.
GISIC performs a gaussian smoothing of the flux array, and identifies molecular bands based on a numerical gradient. Continuum points are then interpolated with a cubic spline.
