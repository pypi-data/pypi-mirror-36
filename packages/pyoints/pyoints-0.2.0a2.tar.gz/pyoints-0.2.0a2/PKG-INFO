Description: # Pyoints
        
        ![logo](./figures/logo_pyoints.png)
        
        *Pyoints* is a python package to conveniently process and analyze point
        cloud data, voxels and raster images. It is intended to be used to support
        the development of advanced algorithms for geo-data processing.
        
        ## General concept
        
        The key idea of *Pyoints* is to provide unified data structures to handle
        points, voxels and rasters in the same manner. It is assumed that the
        data can be interpreted as a two or three dimensional point cloud. Thus we have
        a collection of geo-objects, here called `GeoRecords`, which are characterized
        by two or three dimensional coordinates `coords`, a spatial reference `proj`
        and a transformation matrix `t`. The spatial reference and transformation
        matrix are required to define the global location of the geo-objects. Next to
        the origin, the transformation matrix also stores the scale and rotation of the
        local coordinate system.
        
        The unified data structures simplify the joint use of point clouds, voxels
        and rasters significantly, while keeping their natural characteristics. To
        ease the processing and analysis, each point, voxel or raster cell are stored
        in the commonly used numpy record array according to its natural structure. For
        example, a three dimensional point cloud represents a set of points, each
        characterized by a coordinate and none to many additional attributes. So the
        points are stored in a one dimensional record array. Conversely raster
        images are stored in a two dimensional record array, which allows for the
        commonly used index access of raster cells. Still, each cell is characterized
        by a coordinate and none to many additional attributes. Three dimensional
        voxels are accordingly represented by three dimensional record arrays.
        
        Since all objects of a voxel or raster are also interpreted as a point cloud,
        spatial neighborhood queries, like nearest neighbors or distance search, can
        be performed with unified functions. Thus, each extension of `GeoRecords`
        provides a spatial index `IndexKD` to conveniently perform efficient
        neighborhood queries. The class `IndexKD` is a wrapper of different spatial
        indices, to handle *k*-dimensional spatial queries of different kinds. The
        spatial indices are always only initialized on demand for performance reasons, 
        but cached for future queries. For example, an instance `geoRecords` of
        `GeoRecords` representing three dimensional points allows to create a three
        dimensional spatial index by calling `geoRecords.indexKD()`. If you are not
        interested in the third dimension, you can call `geoRecords.indexKD(2)` to
        perform two dimensional spatial queries.
        
        If you just want to handle coordinates without additional attributes, the class
        `Coords` might interest you. This class also provides the `IndexKD` feature,
        but waives to use of a projection and transformation matrix.
        
        
        ## When is Pyoints suitable for me?
        
        Based on the general concept of *Pyoints* presented above, a bunch of
        algorithms, functions and filters have been implemented, to process geo-data
        with low programming efforts.
        
        Of course, one might wonder whether Python is adequate to analyze point cloud 
        data since other languages languages are much more efficient. This is obviously 
        true, but in the experience of the author, Python is very useful to implement 
        and test new algorithms very quickly. Algorithms for point cloud analysis and
        processing often rely on spatial neighborhood queries. Since *Pyoints*
        takes advantage of very efficient Python libraries, which are basically
        wrappers for binaries written in more efficient languages, the performance
        loss is limited. Additionally, *Pyoints* takes care of selecting and caching
        appropiate spatial indices for you, so you can focus on the core of your 
        algorithm idea.
        
        So, if you have an algorithm idea and you want to implement it quickly and play
        around with different settings, *Pyoints* is made for you. After finding an
        approiate algorithm it can be implemented in a more efficient language
        if you like. Thus *Pyoints* is particulary designed for scientists and
        developers of new geo-spatial algorithms.
        
        
        
        # Installation (Ubuntu)
        
        ## Install external dependencies
        
        The following dependencies have to be installed manually, since they are 
        required by the pip packages.
        
        ### Python
        
        The *Pyoints* targets Python3 >= 3.5.
        
        
        ### Gdal
        
        ```
        sudo apt install gdal-bin
        sudo apt install libgdal-dev
        ```
        
        ### libspatialindex
        
        ```
        apt install libspatialindex-dev
        ```
        
        ### Liblas
        
        ```
        apt install liblas-c3
        ```
        
        
        ## Install Pyoints (Ubuntu)
        
        Unfortunately, the gdal version is not detected automatically by `pgdal`.
        Thus, installation with `setup.py` might fail.
        
        
        ### Installation via pip (recommended)
        
        ```
        pip install pygdal==$(gdal-config --version).* pyoints
        ```
        
        ## Installation with from source
        
        ```
        pip install pygdal==$(gdal-config --version).* -r requirements.txt --upgrade
        ```
        
        
        ### Installation with installation script
        
        The installation script asks you to provide a virtual Python environment
        (virtualenv). You need to initialize it first.
        ```
        ./scripts/pip_install.sh -v path/to/virtualenv
        ```
        
        
        
        # Development
        
        ## Virtualenv
        
        ### Install Virtualenv
        
        Installation (Ubuntu)
        ```
        apt install virtualenv
        ```
        
        Initialize
        ```
        cd /path/to/library
        virtualenv venv
        ```
        
        ### Activate virtualenv
        
        Linux
        ```
        cd /path/to/library
        . venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        Windows
        ```
        cd path\to\library
        venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
