## berens2009
A dataset providing the orientation tuning properties of three neurons recorded from the primary visual cortex of awake macaques. The number of action potentials such neurons fire is modulated by the orientation of a visual stimulus such as an oriented grating.  The main variables are (1) the stimulus orientations (spaced 22.5 degrees apart) and (2) the number of spikes fired in response to each orientation of the stimulus.

#### Reference
Berens (2009). Used in the CircStats Matlab toolbox.

#### Useful for
Circular statistics.

#### Structure
- 3 columns (*Orientation*, *N1Spikes*, *N2Spikes*, *N3Spikes*)
- 8 rows

## ryan2013
This data set provides the extent to which men and women want to kill arthropods that vary in frighteningness (low, high) and disgustingness (low, high). Each participant rates their attitudes towards all anthropoids.

#### Reference
Ryan et al. (2013). Used in JASP.

#### Useful for
Repeated measures and mixed ANOVA.
Test the relation between hostility towards insects and their disgustingness and frighteningness for males and females separately

#### Structure
- 7 columns (*Subject*, *Gender*, *Region*, *Education*, *DesireToKill*, *Disgustingness*, *Frighteningness*)
- 372 rows

The desire to kill was indicated on a scale from 0 to 10.
