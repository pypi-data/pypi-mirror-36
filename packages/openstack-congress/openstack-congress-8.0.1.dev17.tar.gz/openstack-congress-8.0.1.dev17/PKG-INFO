        What is Congress
        ================
        
        Congress is an open policy framework for the cloud.  With Congress, a
        cloud operator can declare, monitor, enforce, and audit "policy" in a
        heterogeneous cloud environment.  Congress gets inputs from a cloud's
        various cloud services; for example in OpenStack, Congress fetches
        information about VMs from Nova, and network state from Neutron, etc.
        Congress then feeds input data from those services into its policy engine
        where Congress verifies that the cloud's actual state abides by the cloud
        operator's policies.  Congress is designed to work with **any policy** and
        **any cloud service**.
        
        Why is Policy Important
        =======================
        
        The cloud is a collection of autonomous
        services that constantly change the state of the cloud, and it can be
        challenging for the cloud operator to know whether the cloud is even
        configured correctly.  For example,
        
        * The services are often independent from each other and do not
          support transactional consistency across services, so a cloud
          management system can change one service (create a VM) without also
          making a necessary change to another service (attach the VM to a
          network).  This can lead to incorrect behavior.
        
        * Other times, we have seen a cloud operator allocate cloud resources
          and then forget to clean them up when the resources are no longer in
          use, effectively leaving garbage around the system and wasting
          resources.
        
        * The desired cloud state can also change over time.  For example, if
          a security vulnerability is discovered in Linux version X, then all
          machines with version X that were ok in the past are now in an
          undesirable state.  A version number policy would detect all the
          machines in that undesirable state.  This is a trivial example, but
          the more complex the policy, the more helpful a policy system
          becomes.
        
        Congress's job is to help people manage that plethora of state across
        all cloud services with a succinct policy language.
        
        Using Congress
        ==============
        
        Setting up Congress involves writing policies and configuring Congress
        to fetch input data from the cloud services.  The cloud operator
        writes policy in the Congress policy language, which receives input
        from the cloud services in the form of tables.  The language itself
        resembles datalog.  For more detail about the policy language and data
        format see :ref:`Policy <policy>`.
        
        To add a service as an input data source, the cloud operator configures a Congress
        "driver," and the driver queries the service.  Congress already
        has drivers for several types of service, but if a cloud operator
        needs to use an unsupported service, she can write a new driver
        without much effort and probably contribute the driver to the
        Congress project so that no one else needs to write the same driver.
        
        Finally, when using Congress, the cloud operator must choose what
        Congress should do with the policy it has been given:
        
        * **monitoring**: detect violations of policy and provide a list of those violations
        * **proactive enforcement**: prevent violations before they happen (functionality that requires
          other services to consult with Congress before making changes)
        * **reactive enforcement**: correct violations after they happen (a manual process that
          Congress tries to simplify)
        
        In the future, Congress
        will also help the cloud operator audit policy (analyze the history
        of policy and policy violations).
