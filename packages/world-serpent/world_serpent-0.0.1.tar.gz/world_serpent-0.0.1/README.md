## What's World Serpent

World Serpent, named after [JÃ¶rmungandr from Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr) is a library for interacting with Mongo. Currently
it provides an easy way of composing Mongo Aggregations with some rudimentary type checking.

Future plans include adding more robust type checking and support for more Mongo Aggregation operators.
