        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        Before running this tool, your beancount files will need some additional
        metadata to help it do its job.
        
        ### Commodities
        
        All the commodities/currency you want to track will need to have the
        `asset-class` and `asset-subclass` metadata strings filled in. The actual
        values are up to you. Here are some examples:
        
        ```beancount
        1867-01-01 commodity CAD
          asset-class: "cash"
          asset-subclass: "cash"
        
        1986-03-13 commodity MSFT
          asset-class: "equity"
          asset-subclass: "us-stock"
        
        1977-01-03 commodity AAPL
          asset-class: "equity"
          asset-subclass: "us-stock"
        
        2007-04-04 commodity VAB
          asset-class: "fixed-income"
          asset-subclass: "ca-bond"
        ```
        
        You will also need valid price directives for all commodities held at cost and
        at least one 'operating_currency' option defined. The values in the report will
        all be converted to the first 'operating_currency' defined. A future version
        will offer a way to specify the currency to use for reporting.
        
        ### Accounts
        
        Accounts need to be part of a specific portfolio to track. Only one portfolio
        is supported by account, but you can have multiple portfolios over multiple
        accounts:
        
        ```beancount
        2000-01-01 open Assets:CA:Employer:PensionPlan
          portfolio: "pension"
        
        2000-01-01 open Assets:CA:Questrade:RRSP
          portfolio: "pension"
        
        2000-01-01 open Assets:CA:Questrade:Trading
          portfolio: "day-trading"
        ```
        
        #### Cash Based Accounts
        
        It is possible to specify `asset-class` and `asset-subclasse` or accounts that
        are reported as a cash-value, but are backed by specific asset classes.
        
        This is use in particular for managed retirement accounts.
        
        ```beancount
        2000-01-01 open Assets:CA:Employer:PensionPlan
          portfolio: "pension"
          asset-class: "fixed-income"
          asset-subclass: "ca-bond"
        ```
        
        ### Target allocations
        
        You can currently define your target allocation percentages for different asset
        subclasses in a portfolio using custom directives. There can currently be only
        one directive for the same portfolio and asset subclass. Missing allocation
        targets will be assumed to be 0%. An example 60/40 portfolio target might look
        like this (*NOT* a financial advice):
        
        ```beancount
        2018-06-14 custom "allocation" "pension" "ca-stock" 30
        2018-06-14 custom "allocation" "pension" "us-stock" 30
        2018-06-14 custom "allocation" "pension" "ca-bond" 40
        ```
