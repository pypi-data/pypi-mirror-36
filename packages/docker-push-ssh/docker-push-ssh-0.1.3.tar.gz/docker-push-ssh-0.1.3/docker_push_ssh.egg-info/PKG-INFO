Description: # docker-push-ssh
        Push docker images from your local machine to remote servers without the hassle.
        
        ## Overview
        `docker-push-ssh` is a command line utility to push docker images from your local machine to your remote machine via ssh.
        
        It creates a private docker registry on your server, establishes a ssh tunnel (so the registry is never exposed to the public),
        and uploads your docker image over this ssh tunnel.
        
        Tested on OS X with "Docker for Mac".
        
        ## Install
        
        Install via pip:
        `pip install docker-push-ssh`
        
        ## Usage:
        
        ```bash
        $ docker-push-ssh --help
        usage: docker-push-ssh [-h] [-i SSH_IDENTITY_FILE] [-p SSH_PORT] [-l LOCAL_IP]
                      ssh_host docker_image
        
        A utility to securely push a docker image from your local host to a remote
        host over ssh without using docker save/load or needing to setup a private
        registry.
        
        positional arguments:
          ssh_host              Host to push docker image to. (ex.
                                username@myhost.com)
          docker_image          Docker image name to push.
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -i SSH_IDENTITY_FILE, --ssh-identity-file SSH_IDENTITY_FILE
                                [required] Path to the ssh identity file on your local
                                host. Required, password auth not supported.
          -p SSH_PORT, --ssh-port SSH_PORT
                                [optional] Port on ssh host to connect to. (Default is
                                22)
          -l LOCAL_IP, --local-ip LOCAL_IP
                                [optional] Ip Address of your local host. Important
                                for systems where docker is run inside a VM (mac,
                                windows). If not provided, a best effort is used to
                                obtain it.
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        
        First create a test image we can use:
        ```bash
        $ mkdir /tmp/testimage && cd /tmp/testimage
        $ echo "FROM alpine" >> ./Dockerfile
        $ echo "RUN touch /etc/testimage" >> ./Dockerfile
        $ docker build -t testimage .
        ```
        
        Now push that test image to our remote server:
        ```bash
        $ docker-push-ssh -i ~/my_identity_file root@myserver.com testimage
        ...
        ```
        
        Now the `testimage` will be present on your server.
        
        ## Caveats
        
        1. SSH password authentication is not supported. Only key files.
        2. If you're using any proxy, you'll need to specify `--local-ip` because it probably won't be inferred correctly.
