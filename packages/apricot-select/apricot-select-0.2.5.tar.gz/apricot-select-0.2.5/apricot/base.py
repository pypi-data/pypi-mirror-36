	"""The base selection object.

	This object defines the structures that all submodular selection algorithms
	should follow. All algorithms will have the same public methods and the
	same attributes.

	Parameters
	----------
	n_samples : int
		The number of samples to return.

	concave_func : str or callable
		The type of concave function to apply to the feature values. You can
		pass in your own function to apply. Otherwise must be one of the
		following:

			'log' : log(1 + X)
			'sqrt' : sqrt(X)
			'min' : min(X, 1)
			'inverse' : 1 / (1 + X)

	verbose : bool
		Whether to print output during the selection process.

	Attributes
	----------
	pq : PriorityQueue
		The priority queue used to implement the lazy greedy algorithm.

	n_samples : int
		The number of samples to select.

	ranking : numpy.array int
		The selected samples in the order of their gain with the first number in
		the ranking corresponding to the index of the first sample that was
		selected by the greedy procedure.

	gains : numpy.array float
		The gain of each sample in the returned set when it was added to the
		growing subset. The first number corresponds to the gain of the first
		added sample, the second corresponds to the gain of the second added
		sample, and so forth.
