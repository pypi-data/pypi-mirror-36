Description: # block_tracing
        
        block_tracing is a tiny Python library that can be used to prevent
        debuggers and other applications from inspecting the memory within
        your process.
        
        This is important for applications that store sensitive material
        in memory, like keys.
        
        # How to Use
        
        Just call a function at the start of execution of your script.
        
        ```python
        from block_tracing import block_tracing
        
        try:
            block_tracing()
        except (NotImplementedError, OSError):
            # handle failures
            pass
        ```
