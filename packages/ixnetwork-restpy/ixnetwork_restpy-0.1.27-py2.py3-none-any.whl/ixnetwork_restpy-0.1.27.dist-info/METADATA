# IxNetwork REST API Client
**This is an alpha build and is subject to change!**

## Features
- classes are generated from the latest released version of IxNetwork
  - the only class that can be directly instantiated is the TestPlatform class
  - all other classes are accessed via a child property on the parent class
  - classes have helper methods depending on the type of class
	- classes that represent a required node are automatically populated with one and only one instance of the node's data
	- classes that represent a user managed list have `add, remove, find` helper methods
	- classes that represent a system managed list have a `find` helper method
  - every instantiated class encapsulates instances retrieved from the server 
  - encapsulated instances can be accessed using iterators or indexes
  - class iterator/index support includes: `__iter__ __next__ __getitem__ __len__`
- `find` method
	- offers named parameters for all properties in the class
	- named parameters can be populated with regex to allow for **finding** specific instances
	- allows the encapsulated data to be reduced to specific instances
	- e.g., to find all virtual ports that have a type of ethernet, the following  `IxNetwork.Vport.find(type='ethernet')` returns a single vport instance that encapsulates all the those vport instances on the server that have type **ethernet**
- installs via pip  
  - pip install -U ixnetwork-restpy
- documentation is inlined in all generated classes  
  - documentation is also available via a static documentation browser distributed with the package under the docs folder
  - there is no need to connect to a running instance of IxNetwork to get API documentation
- samples distributed with the package under the tests folder
	- these samples are also used to sanity test the package before posting it to pypi

## Limitations
- minimum IxNetwork support is 8.42

## Getting Started
```
from ixnetwork_restpy.testplatform.testplatform import TestPlatform

# create the connection to a test platform
test_platform = TestPlatform('127.0.0.1')
test_platform.Authenticate('admin', 'admin')

# add a session
sessions = test_platform.Sessions.add()

# get the root node of the IxNetwork hierarchy
ixnetwork = sessions.Ixnetwork

# add 3 virtual ports
vports = ixnetwork.Vport.add().add().add()

# create a raw traffic item with the 3 virtual ports
traffic_item = ixnetwork.Traffic.TrafficItem.add(name='Raw Traffic')
endpoint_set = traffic_item.EndpointSet.add(sources=vports)
```
