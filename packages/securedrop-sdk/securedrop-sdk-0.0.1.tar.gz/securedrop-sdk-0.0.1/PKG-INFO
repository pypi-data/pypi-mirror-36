Description: ## Python Client for SecureDrop
        
        Note: This is not an official recommended project.
        
        ### Development
        
        This project uses [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org) to manage all dependencies.
        This is a Python3 project.
        
        We are using [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org) for type annotation checks.
        
        ### Code formatting
        
        We are using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tool for code formatting. There is a dockerfile
        in the repository, which can be used to run Black on the code.
        
        ```
        docker build -t kdas/black -f Dockerfile.black
        docker run --rm -v $PWD:/home/kdas/workplace kdas/black black .
        ```
        
        Note: The dockerfile still needs work.
        
        
        We cover all the API calls of SecureDrop.
        
        Note: The `get_source` will get an update to take a Source object as an input.
        
        We will also add a bunch of more tests.
        
        
        ### Testing
        
        To test the code, you will need to run the SecureDrop `make dev` command in the same system. The test suite for
        this project will test against that development container.
