        """
        Create an Analytics Query object. This may be passed as the
        `params` argument to :class:`AnalyticsRequest`.

        :param querystr: The query string to execute
        :param args: Positional placeholder arguments. These satisfy
            the placeholder values for positional placeholders in the
            query string, demarcated by ``?``.
        :param kwargs: Named placeholder arguments. These satisfy
            named placeholders in the query string, such as
            ``$name``, ``$email`` and so on. For the placeholder
            values, omit the leading dollar sign (``$``).

        Use positional parameters::

            q = AnalyticsQuery("SELECT VALUE bw FROM breweries "
                               "bw WHERE bw.name = ?", 'Kona Brewing')

            for row in cb.analytics_query(q, "127.0.0.1"):
                print('Got {}'.format(str(row))

        Use named parameters::

            q = AnalyticsQuery("SELECT VALUE bw FROM breweries "
                               "bw WHERE bw.name = $brewery", brewery='Kona Brewing')
            for row in cb.analytics_query(q, "127.0.0.1"):
                print('Got {}'.format(str(row))


        When using placeholders, ensure that the placeholder value is
        the *unserialized* (i.e. native) Python value, not the JSON
        serialized value. For example the query
        ``SELECT VALUE bw FROM breweries bw WHERE bw.name IN
        ['Kona Brewing','21st Amendment Brewery Cafe']``
        can be rewritten using placeholders:

        Correct::

            AnalyticsQuery('SELECT VALUE bw FROM breweries bw WHERE bw.name IN ?',
                      ['Kona Brewing', '21st Amendment Brewery Cafe'])

        Incorrect::

            AnalyticsQuery('SELECT VALUE bw FROM breweries bw WHERE bw.name IN ?',
                      "[\\"Kona Brewing\\",\\"21st Amendment Brewery Cafe\\"]")
        Since the placeholders are serialized to JSON internally anyway.
