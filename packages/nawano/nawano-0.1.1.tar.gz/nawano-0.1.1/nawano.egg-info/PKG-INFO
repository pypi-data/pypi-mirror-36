        Nawano is a lightweight, secure and fast [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) command-line application that provides a simple and intuative interface for managing Nano funds
        
        Seeds are encrypted with AES-256 and stored along with information about derivate keys locally.
        
        Please bare in mind that—just as the official Nano software—Nawano uses the *BSD 2-Clause License* (i.e. no liability for loss of funds).
