Description: # Treelogger
        
        This package adds structure to your application logs by creating a tree structure for functions that execute within functions.
        
        These nested functions can be very troublesome to troubleshoot using a regular logger, but by using the tree logger, you can easily see the chain of events and drill down to where the error occurs. 
        
        Below is an example of what the tree would look like. The example shows how output of a function can be nested to the appropriate level. 
        
        ```
        Function Stand_Up 
        -"Begin Standing Up" 
        --Function Move_Legs
        ---"Moving Legs" 
        ----Function Check_Balance
        -----"Balance is Good"
        ----Finish Check_Balance
        ---"Leg Movement Sucessful"
        -- Finish Move_Legs 
        -"Stand Up took 1 Second(s)" 
        Finish Stand_up
        ```
        
        To begin tree logging, import the tree object and treewrap decorator into your modules. 
        
        ```
        #test.py 
        
        from treelogger import tree, treewrap 
        
        
        @treewrap()
        def showthis(value):
            tree.log(value)
        
            return
        
        @treewrap()
        def nest(value):
        
            tree.log('Nesting a value of %i' % value)
        
            showthis(value)
        
            tree.log('Nesting a value of %i + 1' % value)
        
            showthis(value + 1)
            
        ```
        
        You can then import things from your modules into one or more main modules. In the main module, use the tree = TreeLogger() form to create a logging instance.
        
        The TreeLogger class instance is a global instance (kind of like sys.stdout) and all of your modules that imported tree will send their logs to the global tree. When defining the global tree, it has 2 default outputs: stdout and text file.
        
        ```
        #main.py
        from test import showthis, nest
        from treelogger import tree, TreeLogger
        
        tree = TreeLogger()
        nest(123)
        
        tree.close_log()
        
        ```
        
        Running main.py would give you the output below. 
        
        ```
        
        <?xml version="1.0" ?>
        <log>
        	<nest>
        		<msg>  Nesting a value of 123  </msg>
        		<showthis>
        			<msg>  123  </msg>
        		</showthis>
        		<msg>  Nesting a value of 123 + 1  </msg>
        		<showthis>
        			<msg>  124  </msg>
                </showthis>
        	</nest>
        </log>
        
        
        ```
        
        As you can see, functions become nested and so do the logging messages for the functions. The resulting XML file can be searched using Xpath or visualized using an XML visualizer. 
        
        A common mistake is to use the treewrap without the (). Unlike other decorators, the brackets are necessary for properly returning values from the decorated function.
