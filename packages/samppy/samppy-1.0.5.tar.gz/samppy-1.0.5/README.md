Package **samppy** implements Hamiltonian Markov-chain sampling and
some additional analysis methods for multivariate probability distributions.

The probability distribution is represented only by
an array of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples
drawn from the distribution, with unifom probability mass for all samples.

The package includes three modules:

* Module **hamiltonian_sampler** implements Hamiltonian Markov-Chain sampling.
    A *HamiltonianSampler* instance can generate
    random samples of a multivariate probability distribution,
    defined only by an non-normalized LOG-LIKELIHOOD function,
    and the GRADIENT of that function.

    The generated batch of sample vectors is stored in a 2D numpy array,
    either as rows or as columns.

    Class `HamiltonianSampler` defines a standard isotropic sampler.
    Class `HamiltonianBoundedSampler` is a subclass also allowing
    one- or two-sided interval limits for all vector elements.

* Module **credibility** includes functions to estimate *jointly credible differences*
    and/or *correlations* between pairs of elements
    in a random vector with a multivariate probability distribution,
    represented only by samples.

* Module **sample_entropy** includes a function to estimate the *differential entropy*
    of a multivariate probability distribution, represented only by samples.
    The entropy is estimated by the Kozachenko-Leonenko nearest-neighbor approximation
    (Singh and Poczos, 2016).

## Usage

This package was developed mainly for use by another project.
It is distributed separately because it may be useful for other purposes.

The Hamiltonian sampler code was inspired by the LAHMC project by
Jasha Sohlstein. The present implementation includes
some safety features to facilitate its use.
The present sampler does *not* include sampling within a general subspace manifold.

## Requirements

The package requires Python 3.6 with Numpy and Scipy installed.
It has been tested with Numpy 1.13 and 1.15, and Scipy 1.0.0 and 1.1.0.
