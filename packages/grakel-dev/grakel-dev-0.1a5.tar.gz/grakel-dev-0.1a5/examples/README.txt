Classification Examples
=======================

Examples that make use of graph kernels and the SVM classifier to perform graph classification. The examples demonstrate the accuracy of various graph kernels (WL-subtree, Shortest-Path, Multiscale-Laplacian, Lovasz/SVM-Theta) on some popular datasets using different experimental settings (simple, manual K-Fold with Grid-Search, Pipeline Grid-search, or randomized K-folds).
