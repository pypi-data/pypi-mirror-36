Description: ========================
        The Machine Learning Hub
        ========================
        
        **UNDER DEVELOPMENT**
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The machine learning hub is an `open source project`_ aimed at easily
        sharing `pre-built machine learning models`_. The models are accessed
        and managed using the *ml* command from the *mlhub* package designed
        to install the model and run a demonstration within 5 minutes.
        
        Visit the `repository index`_ on `mlhub.ai`_ where the models
        themselves can be browsed from the `main pool`_.

        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        The command line interface can be installed using `PyPi`_::
        
          $ pip3 install mlhub
          
        Once installed you will be able to run the sample rain-tomorrow model
        assuming that you have the free and open source `R statistical
        software package`_ installed. The TL;DR version is below. Note that
        you type the command ``ml ...`` and that everything from the ``#`` to
        the end of the line is ignored (it's a comment)::
        
          $ ml install   rain-tomorrow # Install the model named rain-tomorrow.
          $ ml demo      rain-tomorrow # Run the demonstration of the model
          $ ml display   rain-tomorrow # Graphical display of pre-built model.
        
        The following commands are available and below is a brief description
        of each command::
        
          $ ml                         # Show a usage message.
          $ ml available               # List of pre-buld models on the MLHub.
          $ ml installed               # List of pre-built models installed locally
          $ ml install   rain-tomorrow # Install the model named rain-tomorrow.
          $ ml readme    rain-tomorrow # View background information about the model.
          $ ml commands  rain-tomorrow # List of commands supported by the model.
          $ ml configure rain-tomorrow # Install required dependencies.
          $ ml demo      rain-tomorrow # Run the demonstration of the model
          $ ml print     rain-tomorrow # Textual summary of the model.
          $ ml display   rain-tomorrow # Graphical display of pre-built model.
          $ ml score     rain-tomorrow # Run model on your own data.
        
        Different model packages will have different dependencies and these
        will be installed by the *configure* command.
