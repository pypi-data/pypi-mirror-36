        ========
        
        This program is a security monitoring program that uses video to detect
        motion, that records motion video, can express speech alerts, can
        express alarms and attempts to communicate alerts as configured.

        setup (Ubuntu 16.04)
        ====================
        
        Python 2 is assumed.
        
        Install OpenCV 2.4.9.1 (``python-opencv=2.4.9.1+dfsg-1.5ubuntu1``,
        ``libopencv-dev=2.4.9.1+dfsg-1.5ubuntu1``).
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt install  \
                python-dev    \
                libasound-dev \
                python-pyaudio\
                libopencv-dev \
                python-opencv \
                python-tk
        
        Install sentinel.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo pip install python_sentinel
        
        Manually create an account on a Matrix homeserver. Add the credentials
        to the scalar configuration file, as described
        `here <https://github.com/wdbm/scalar>`__.
        
        usage
        =====
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sentinel --help
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sentinel --display_windows=false --launch_delay=120 --record_duration=15 --message=true
        
        future
        ======
        
        Migration from OpenCV 2 to OpenCV 3 or 4 is under consideration (which
        would result in compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04).
