class SkyQ:
    """Main Sky Q class definition.

    This is the main SkyQ Class definition which provides all available access
    to the SkyQ box that is currently implemented.

    Attributes:
        host (str): Hostname or IPv4 address of SkyQ Box.
        remote_port (int): Port number to use to connect to the Remote TCP socket.
            Defaults to the standard port used by SkyQ boxes which is 49160.
        logger (logging.Logger): Standard Python logger object which if not passed will
            instantiate a local logger.
        remote (SkyRemote): An instance of the SkyRemote class which can be used to
            call the lower-level remote API which essentially emulated button-presses on
            the SkyQ Remote.

    Todos:
        * Add interface to read EPG
        * Add higher level channel selector interface to pick channels by name, rather than number.
        * Add misc higher level interfaces to give "now and next" type responses.
