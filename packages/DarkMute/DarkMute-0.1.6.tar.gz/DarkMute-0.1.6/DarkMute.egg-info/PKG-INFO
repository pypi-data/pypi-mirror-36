Description: # Dark Mute
        
        Dark Mute is python script that mutes snapcast client volume 
        when it senses lights are off in the room.
        
        It's written in Python 3 and requires a  photoresistor-capacitor circuit 
        connected to a Raspberry Pi running Snapcast.
        
        # Setup/Usage
        
        As the `pi` user in its home directory:
        
        * `python3 -m venv darkmute-venv`
        * `. darkmute-venv/bin/activate`
        * `sudo python3 -m pip install DarkMute`
        
        To run this as a service, create a systemd service definition. Instructions pending.
        
        # Developer Setup
        
        * Clone this from [gitlab](https://git.xhost.io/jess/Dark-Mute)
        * Create and activate Python 3 virtual env
        * `pip install -e .` to install dependencies
        * Build the circuit, connected to GPIO Pin 7 
        * add user to gpio group [/dev/gpiomem](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/40106)
