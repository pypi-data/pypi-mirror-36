Description: Continuous cURL
        ===============
        
        Continually test an endpoint over time, keeping track of http status
        codes. Similar to ping -c but with curl.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        When doing deployments or making critical infrastructure changes I like
        to get the quickest feedback possible on any failures. Rather than wait
        a minute or so for Pingdom or Pagerduty to go off, I'd like to know
        within a second or two if health indicators start failing. So I like to
        continually curl the health endpoint for any services I'm touching to
        make sure they continue to return 200's, else let me know right away.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ pip install ccurl
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            # GET request on www.google.com 10 times
            ccurl --url www.google.com --repeat 10
        
            # GET request on www.google.com 100 times with a 2 second sleep between requests
            ccurl --url www.google.com --repeat 100 --delay 2
        
        Publishing Updates to PyPi
        --------------------------
        
        For the maintainer - to publish an updated version of ssm-search,
        increment the version number in version.py and run the following:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            docker build -f ./Dockerfile.buildenv -t ccurl:build .
            docker run --rm -it --entrypoint make ccurl:build publish
        
        At the prompts, enter the username and password to the pypi.org repo.
