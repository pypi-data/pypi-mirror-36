        ## Usage
        
        1. Install:
        
            ```
            pip install django-pyuwsgi
            ```
        
        2. Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
        
            ```python
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
               # ...
               "django_pyuwsgi",
               # ...
            ]
            ```
        3. Run:
            
            ```
            manage.py pyuwsgi --socket=:8000 ...
            ```
        
        Don't worry about setting the module you want to run or virtualenv/home, that will already be handled for you via the `WSGI_APPLICATION` setting and your current Python interpreter. If you've configured your static files to be served from a local URL, they'll be setup too.
        
        ## Motivation
        
        In some scenarios, it is beneficial to distribute a Django project with a single entrypoint for command-line interaction. This can come in handy when building Docker containers or self-contained Python apps with something like [shiv](https://github.com/linkedin/shiv).
