This software uses setuptools_scm to determine the package version number.  In short this uses git tags
to determine the version of the package.  As an example to set the version for this package a git tag must
be made with the version number as the tag name.  This can be achieved like so::

 git tag -a v0.1.4 -m "Version 0.1.4"
