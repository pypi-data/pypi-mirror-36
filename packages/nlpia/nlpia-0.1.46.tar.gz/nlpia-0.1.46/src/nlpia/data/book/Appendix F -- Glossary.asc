We've collected some definitions of some common NLP and ML acronyms and terminology here.footnote:[Bill Wilson at the university of New South Wales in Australia has a more complete one here: https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/nlpdict.html]
You can find some of the tools we used to generate this list in the `nlpia` python package at https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/src/nlpia/transcoders.py:[github.com/totalgood/nlpia]].
