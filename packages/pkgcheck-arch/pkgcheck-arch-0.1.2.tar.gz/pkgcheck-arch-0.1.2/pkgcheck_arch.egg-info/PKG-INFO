        - E004: file did not end with a newline
        - E005: unquoted $srcdir or $pkgdir
        
        Structure Errors
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A set of rules that help keep things consistent in control blocks.
        These are ignored on long lines that have a continuation, because
        unrolling that is kind of "interesting"
        
        - E010: *do* not on the same line as *for*
        - E011: *then* not on the same line as *if* or *elif*
        - E012: heredoc didn't end before EOF
        - E020: Function declaration not in format ``^function name {$``
        
        Obsolete, deprecated or unsafe syntax
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Rules to identify obsolete, deprecated or unsafe syntax that should
        not be used
        
        - E040: Syntax errors reported by `bash -n`
        - E041: Usage of $[ for arithmetic is deprecated for $((
        - W042: Local declaration hides errors
        - W043: Arithmetic compound has inconsistent return semantics
        - E044: Use [[ for =~,<,> comparisions
        
        Style enforcer
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - E060: Last line isn't a newline
        - E061: Multiple final newlines
        - W062: Unsafe quotes
