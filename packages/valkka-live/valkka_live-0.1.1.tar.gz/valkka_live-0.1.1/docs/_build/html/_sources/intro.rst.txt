Valkka Live is modular, hackable and customizable OpenSource approach to modern video surveillance and management solutions in local area networks.

The graphical user interface, widgets, alerts and streaming logic is programmed in Python and Qt.  This results in sleek and responsive user interfaces.  Python machine vision modules are easy to implement and plug in.

The underlying media engine (**valkka-core** library) is written in C++ and it has native Python3 interface.  Video streaming is done using OpenGL texture streaming, which opens a number of possibilities, say, digital video zooming and fisheye projections.

Valkka Live works with standard RTSP and OnVif compliant cameras and has been designed for massive video streaming and analysis.

The OpenSource version of Valkka Live demonstrates some basic capabilities of the **valkka-core** programming library together with Python3 and Qt.  

For all features of **valkka-core**, refer to `valkka python examples <https://elsampsa.github.io/valkka-examples/>`_.
