Welcome to the SRT Single Dish Tools documentation!
===================================================

Introduction
------------
The Sardinia Radio Telescope Single Dish Tools (SDT) are a set of Python
tools designed for the quicklook and analysis of single-dish radio data,
starting from the backends present at the Sardinia Radio Telescope.
They are composed of a Python (2.7, 3.4+) library for developers
and a set of command-line scripts to soften the learning curve for new users.

The Python library is written following the modern coding standards
documented in the Astropy Coding Guidelines. Automatic tests cover
a significant fraction of the code, and are launched each time a commit
is pushed to the `Github`_ repository.
The Continuous Integration service `Travis CI`_ is used for that.
The current version is 0.5-devXXX, indicating the development version towards 0.5.
See below the tentative roadmap.

In the current implementation, spectroscopic and total-power on-the-fly
scans are supported, both as part of standalone flux measurements through
"cross scans" and as parts
of a map. Maps are formed through a series of scans that swipe the source
region.

   The first is able to produce images, the second is used to obtain quick
   flux measurements of point-like sources.

Tentative Roadmap
-----------------

+ v.0.1: Simple map creation, draft calibrated fluxes

+ v.0.2: Stable calibrated fluxes, use of multibeam in the K band

+ v.0.3: Stabilization of interactive interface

+ v.0.4: Generalized, user-supplied scanset filters

+ v.**0.5**: Converters to MBFITS and CLASS

+ v.0.6: Improved calibration, accept input gain curves

+ v.0.7: Improved RFI support, using simple techniques of machine learning

+ v.0.8: Full support of general coordinate systems, including Galactic

+ v.1.0: code release.


Installation
------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anaconda and virtual environment (recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We strongly suggest to install the
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ Python distribution.
Once the installation has finished, you should have a working ``conda``
command in your shell. First of all, create a new environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda create -n py3 python=3

load the new environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ source activate py3

and install the dependencies (including a few optional but recommended):

.. code-block:: console

    (py3) $ conda install astropy>=3 scipy numpy matplotlib pyyaml h5py statsmodels numba

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyregion


Other Python distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the dependencies with pip (including a few optional but
recommended):

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install astropy>=3 scipy numpy matplotlib pyyaml h5py statsmodels numba pyregion

Cloning and installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    (py3) $ cd /my/software/directory/
    (py3) $ git clone https://github.com/matteobachetti/srt-single-dish-tools.git

or if you have deployed your SSH key to Github:

.. code-block:: console

    (py3) $ git clone git@github.com:matteobachetti/srt-single-dish-tools.git

Then:

.. code-block:: console

    (py3) $ cd srt-single-dish-tools
    (py3) $ python setup.py install

That's it. After installation has ended, you can verify that software is
installed by executing:

.. code-block:: console

    (py3) $ SDTimage -h

If the help message appears, you're done!

Updating
~~~~~~~~

To update the code, simply run ``git pull`` and reinstall:

.. code-block:: console

    (py3) $ git pull
    (py3) $ python setup.py install
