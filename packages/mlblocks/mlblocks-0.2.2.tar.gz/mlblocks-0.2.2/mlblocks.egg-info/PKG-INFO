        MLBlocks is a simple framework for composing end-to-end tunable Machine Learning Pipelines by
        seamlessly combining tools from any python library with a simple, common and uniform interface.

        # Installation
        
        The simplest and recommended way to install MLBlocks is using `pip`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install mlblocks
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can also clone the repository and install it from sources
        
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:HDI-Project/MLBlocks.git
        cd MLBlocks
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        # Usage Example
        
        Below there is a short example about how to use MLBlocks to create a simple pipeline, fit it
        using demo data and use it to make predictions.
        
        For advance usage and more detailed explanation about each component, please have a look
        at the [documentation](https://HDI-Project.github.io/MLBlocks)
        
        ## Additional Libraries
        
        In order to be able to execute the given code snippets, you will need to install a couple of
        additional libraries, which you can do by running:
        
        ```bash
        pip install mlblocks[demo]
        ```
        
        ## Creating a pipeline
        
        With MLBlocks, creating a pipeline is as simple as specifying a list of primitives and passing
        them to the `MLPipeline` class:
        
        ```python
        >>> from mlblocks import MLPipeline
        >>> primitives = [
        ...     'sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler',
        ...     'xgboost.XGBClassifier'
        ... ]
        >>> pipeline = MLPipeline(primitives)
        ```
        
        Optionally, specific hyperparameters can be also set by specifying them in a dictionary:
        
        ```python
        >>> hyperparameters = {
        ...     'xgboost.XGBClassifier': {
        ...         'learning_rate': 0.1
        ...     }
        ... }
        >>> pipeline = MLPipeline(primitives, hyperparameters)
        ```
        
        If you can see which hyperparameters a particular pipeline is using, you can do so by calling
        its `get_hyperparameters` method:
        
        ```python
        >>> import json
        >>> hyperparameters = pipeline.get_hyperparameters()
        >>> print(json.dumps(hyperparameters, indent=4))
        {
            "sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler#1": {
                "with_mean": true,
                "with_std": true
            },
            "xgboost.XGBClassifier#1": {
                "n_jobs": -1,
                "learning_rate": 0.1,
                "n_estimators": 10,
                "max_depth": 3,
                "gamma": 0,
                "min_child_weight": 1
            }
        }
        ```
        
        ### Making predictions
        
        Once we have created the pipeline with the desired hyperparameters we can fit it
        and then use it to make predictions on new data.
        
        To do this, we first call the `fit` method passing the training data and the corresponding labels.
        
        ```python
        >>> from mlblocks.datasets import load_iris
        >>> dataset = load_iris()
        >>> pipeline.fit(dataset.train_data, dataset.train_target)
        ```
        
        Once we have fitted our model to our data, we can call the `predict` method passing new data
        to obtain predictions from the pipeline.
        
        ```python
        >>> predictions = pipeline.predict(dataset.test_data)
        >>> predictions
        array([2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1,
               0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2])
        >>> dataset.score(dataset.test_target, predictions)
        0.9736842105263158
        ```
        
        # History
        
        In its first iteration in 2015, MLBlocks was designed for only multi table, multi entity temporal
        data. A good reference to see our design rationale at that time is Bryan Collazo’s thesis:
        * [Machine learning blocks](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mlblocks_Bryan.pdf).
          Bryan Collazo. Masters thesis, MIT EECS, 2015.
        
        With recent availability of a multitude of libraries and tools, we decided it was time to integrate
        them and expand the library to address other data types: images, text, graph, time series and
        integrate with deep learning libraries.

        This is a summary of the changes:
        
        * Primitives JSONs and Python code has been moved to a different repository, called MLPrimitives
        * Optional usage of multiple JSON primitive folders.
        * JSON format has been changed to allow more flexibility and features:
            * input and output arguments, as well as argument types, can be specified for each method
            * both classes and function as primitives are supported
            * multitype and conditional hyperparameters fully supported
            * data modalities and primitive classifiers introduced
            * metadata such as documentation, description and author fields added
        * Parsers are removed, and now the MLBlock class is responsible for loading and reading the
          JSON primitive.
        * Multiple blocks of the same primitive are supported within the same pipeline.
        * Arbitrary inputs and outputs for both pipelines and blocks are allowed.
        * Shared variables during pipeline execution, usable by multiple blocks.
