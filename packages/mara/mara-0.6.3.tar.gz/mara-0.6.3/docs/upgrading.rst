.. _instructions:

Instructions
============

1. Check which version of Mara you are upgrading from::

    python -c "import mara; print mara.__version__"

2. Upgrade the Mara package::

    pip install mara --upgrade

3. Upgrade your code following the upgrade instructions below for **all**
   appropriate versions.


Upgrading from 0.5.0
--------------------

Mara 0.6.0 now supports unicode when calling ``write`` and ``write_all`` on a
client or container, or when receiving data. The ``client.write_raw`` method
only supports bytestrings, so should not be used for suppressing the newline
character; instead pass the ``newline`` keyword argument to ``write``
(supported by client, container and user classes)::

    client.write('Enter something: ', newline=False)

There should not be any other changes required for unicode support; the client
manages convertion between byte strings and utf-8, and the ``write`` methods
support either. Received data in Receive events are now unicode strings.

Unicode support does not affect services operating with
:ref:`setting_socket_raw` set to ``True``.

The angel now waits until after a new service has called ``PostStart`` and
``PostRestart`` before terminating the old service, so anything which needs to
be cleaned (eg open filehandles) before that happens should take place in
``PreRestart``.


Upgrading from 0.4.0
--------------------

The class ``mara.service.Service`` now inherits from
``container.ClientContainer``, which means the ``get_all`` attribute has been
renamed to ``filter_clients``.

The class ``mara.storage.StoreField`` has been removed; replace your use of it
with the normal ``mara.storage.Field``, which can now automatically serialise
and deserialise references to ``Store`` instances. The field now also supports
the use of store instances in list and dict values.

Client serialisers have been removed; you should now write custom fields with
their own ``serialise`` and ``deserialise`` methods, which can then set
attributes on the client object; see ``ClientField`` in
:source:`mara/contrib/useres/base.py` for an example.

The module ``mara.contrib.commands.socials`` is no longer imported into
``mara.contrib.commands``, so change your imports to specify the ``socials``
module.

The command function ``mara.contrib.users.cmd_list_users`` has been renamed to
``cmd_list_all_users``. That command and the two admin commands,
``cmd_list_admin`` and ``cmd_set_admin``, no longer need the ``User`` context.

The talker example now uses the command registry's built-in aliases feature
instead of defining a custom command - see
:ref:`contrib_commands_aliases`, :source:`mara/contrib/users/commands.py` and
:source:`examples/talker/commands.py`.

The social command generator takes different arguments; for normal usage it
now only needs the command registry, eg ``gen_social_cmds(commands)``.

The undocumented colour functions and ``HR`` have been removed from ``util`` in
favour of the new :ref:`module_styles` classes.

``Store`` classes now cannot have fields named ``active`` - it is now a
reserved word. If you have a field with this name, you will need to rename it.
