See the `Documentation <http://radiac.net/projects/mara/documentation/>`_
for details of how Mara works.


Quickstart
==========

Install Mara with ``pip install mara``, then write your service using
`event handlers <http://radiac.net/projects/mara/documentation/api/events/>`_.

A minimal Mara service looks something like this::

    from mara import Service, events
    service = Service()

    @service.listen(events.Receive)
    def receive(event):
        event.client.write(event.data)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        service.run()

Save it as ``echo.py`` and run it::

    python echo.py
    * Server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000

Override settings `in code <http://radiac.net/projects/mara/documentation/introduction/#settings>`_,
or by passing arguments on the command line::

    python echo.py --host=10.0.0.11 --port=8000
    * Server listening on 10.0.0.11:8000

Take a look at the
`examples <https://github.com/radiac/mara/tree/master/examples>`_ to see how to
start writing more complex services, or read the
`documentation <http://radiac.net/projects/mara/documentation/>`_ for
details of how Mara works.
