pyqt5-tools
===========

|AppVeyor|_

The PyQt5 wheels do not provide tools such as Qt Designer that were included in
the old binary installers. This package aims to provide those in a separate
package which is useful for developers while the official PyQt5 wheels stay
focused on fulfilling the dependencies of PyQt5 applications.

For each tool a script is created such that you get files like
``Scripts\designer.exe`` to launch the programs.

There is a ``Scripts\pyqt5designer.exe`` entry point that will help fill out
``PYQTDESIGNERPATH`` from either command line arguments or a ``.env`` file.
Unknown arguments are passed through to the original Qt Designer program.

.. code-block::

  Usage: pyqt5designer [OPTIONS]

  Options:
    -p, --widget-path DIRECTORY  Paths to be combined with PYQTDESIGNERPATH
    --designer-help              Pass through to get Designer's --help
    --help                       Show this message and exit.

If you want to use ``Form`` > ``View Code...`` from within Designer you can
run ``Scripts\pyqt5toolsinstalluic.exe`` and it will copy ``pyuic5.exe``
such that Designer will use it and show you generated Python code.  ``pyqt5``
must already be installed or this script will be unable to find the original
``pyuic5.exe`` to copy.

In addition to the standard features of the official Designer plugin, this
provides an exception dialog for your widget's Python code.  Otherwise Designer
in Windows silently crashes on Python exceptions.

The QML plugin is also included for use with ``qmlscene.exe`` and
``qmltestrunner.exe``.
