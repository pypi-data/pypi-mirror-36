        *Chicago, IL*
        
        * Improved data pipeline and research infrastructure reliability and usability.
        * Added parallelism to data ingestion and created automated sanity checking to reduce overhead of analysis.
        * Developed a Python package for quickly scripting models and risk calculation on live market data.

        ## Projects
        ### [GPU Compression](https://github.com/yiwensong/lzss)
        
        * Parallelized implementation of LZSS compression for the GPU.
        * The goal of the project was to test feasibility of using message compression in HPC applications.
        * Result: your network needs to be *really* bad for this to be worth anything.
        * Implemented in CUDA and deployed on AWS.
        
        ### [ImgCompress](https://github.com/yiwensong/imgcompress)
        
        * ImgCompress is a hackathon project aimed at becoming the future of compression.
        * Uploads binaries to Imgur as PNGs and stores the 7 character Imgur URL.
        * Compression ratio is over 700 000 and implementation is less than 200 lines of python.
        * Better than the CUDA stuff I made.
        
        ### [Poker AI](https://github.com/yiwensong/huplo)
        
        * Heads Up Pot-Limit Omaha (HUPLO) AI that uses Monte Carlo search trees and bad machine learning.
        * Preflop play uses machine learning on hole cards features like connectedness, suitedness and value.
        * Postflop play uses Monte Carlo Search Trees.
        * ðŸ’© at poker.
        * Passable at Tic-Tac-Toe.
        
        ### [Yet Another Personal Site | DefDontHire.Me](https://github.com/yiwensong/yiwensong.github.io)
        
        * Technology has advanced to a point where you can create a beautiful website without knowing any web.
        * Literally anyone can download a Bootstrap template and write some BS and call it a personal site.
        * [Exhibit A](http://yiwensong.com)
        
        ### [yiwen.date](https://github.com/yiwensong/yiwen.date)
