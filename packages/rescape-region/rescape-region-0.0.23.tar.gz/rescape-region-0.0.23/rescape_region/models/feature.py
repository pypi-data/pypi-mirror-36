        Models a geospatial feature along with some metadata. The metadata like name and description
        could be populated by the geojson that populates the geometry column
        (using for instance rescape_python_helpers.geometry_from_geojson).
        The reason we make a separate model for Feature rather than having classes like Region just use a
        GeometryField or GeometryCollectionField directly has to do with the implementation supporting
        geospatial fields in graphene, which can't handle multiple geospatial fields but can handle multiple
        foreign keys that point to objects one geospatial field.
