Description: # GraphWaveFunctionCollapse
        
        A python 3.x package to color a graph based on patterns extracted from an colored example graph.
        This algorithm is based on [WaveFunctionCollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse).

        Install with
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        After installing you can run an example by going into the directory (e.g. /examples/beach) and calling
        ```
        python python -m graphwfc -v value
        ```
        All examples use the attribute 'value' as color. 
        
        An autogenerated [documenation](https://lamelizard.github.io/GraphWaveFunctionCollapse/graphwfc.html) is available.
        
        Example Code
        ```python
        import networkx as nx
        import graphwfc
        GI = nx.Graph([(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)])
        GI.add_nodes_from([(1,{'c':1}),(2,{'c':1}),(3,{'c':2}),(4,{'c':3})])
        GL = nx.Graph([(1,2)])
        GO = nx.random_tree(1000)
        S = graphwfc.GraphWFCState(GO=GO,GLs=[GL],GI=GI,node_attr='c')
        while not S.run():
            S.reset()
        nx.write_graphml(S.GO, "out.graphml")
        ```
        
        # Remarks
        undirected Graphs are nearly untested. Since edges are only used to get subgraph isomorphisms this _should_ be fine.
