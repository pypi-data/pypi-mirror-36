HTRC-Features |Build Status| |PyPI version| |Anaconda-Server Badge|
===================================================================

Tools for working with the `HTRC Extracted Features
dataset <https://sharc.hathitrust.org/features>`__, a dataset of
page-level text analysis features extracted from from 4.8 million public
domain volumes.

This library provides a ``FeatureReader`` for parsing files, which are
handled as ``Volume`` objects with collections of ``Page`` objects.
Volumes provide access to metadata (e.g. language), volume-wide feature
information (e.g. token counts), and access to Pages. Pages allow you to
easily parse page-level features, particularly token lists.

This library makes heavy use of `Pandas <pandas.pydata.org>`__,
returning many data representations as DataFrames. This is the leading
way of dealing with structured data in Python, so this library doesn't
try to reinvent the wheel. Since refactoring around Pandas, the primary
benefit of using the HTRC Feature Reader is performance: reading the
json structures and parsing them is generally faster than custom code.
You also get convenient access to common information, such as
case-folded token counts or part-of-page specific character counts.
Details of the public methods provided by this library can be found in
the `HTRC Feature Reader
docs <http://htrc.github.io/htrc-feature-reader/htrc_features/feature_reader.m.html>`__.

Installation
------------

To install,

.. code:: bash

        pip install htrc-feature-reader

That's it! This library is written for Python 2.7 and 3.0+. For Python
beginners, you'll need
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__.

Alternately, if you are using
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__, you can install with

.. code:: bash

        conda install -c htrc htrc-feature-reader

This approach is recommended, because it makes sure that some of the
hard-to-install dependencies are properly installed.

Given the nature of data analysis, using iPython with Jupyter notebooks
for preparing your scripts interactively is a recommended convenience.
Most basically, it can be installed with
``pip install ipython[notebook]`` and run with ``ipython notebook`` from
the command line, which starts a session that you can access through
your browser. If this doesn't work, consult the `iPython
documentation <http://ipython.readthedocs.org/>`__.

Optional: `installing the development
version <#Installing-the-development-version>`__.

Usage
-----

*Note: for new Python users, a more in-depth lesson is published by
Programming Historian: `Text Mining in Python through the HTRC Feature
Reader <http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/text-mining-with-extracted-features>`__.
That lesson is also the official citation associated the HTRC Feature
Reader library.*

Reading feature files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to start using this library is to use the
`FeatureReader <http://htrc.github.io/htrc-feature-reader/htrc_features/feature_reader.m.html#htrc_features.feature_reader.FeatureReader>`__
interface, which takes a list of paths.

.. code:: python

    import glob
    import pandas as pd
    from htrc_features import FeatureReader
    paths = glob.glob('data/PZ-volumes/*.json.bz2')
    # Here we're loading five paths, for brevity
    fr = FeatureReader(paths[:5])
    for vol in fr.volumes():
        print("%s - %s" % (vol.id, vol.title))


.. parsed-literal::

Iterating on ``FeatureReader`` returns ``Volume`` objects. This is
simply an easy way to access ``feature_reader.volumes()``. Wherever
possible, this library tries not to hold things in memory, so most of
the time you want to iterate rather than casting to a list. In addition
to memory issues, since each volume needs to be read from a file and
initialized, it will be slow. *Woe to whomever tries
``list(FeatureReader.volumes())``*.

The method for creating a path list with 'glob' is just one way to do
so. For large sets, it's better to just have a text file of your paths,
and read it line by line.

The feature reader also has a useful method,
``multiprocessing(map_func)``, for chunking a running functions across
multiple processes. This is an advanced feature, but extremely helpful
for any large-scale processing.

In addition to iterating on ``feature_reader.volumes()``, there is a
convenient function to grab the first volume in a feature reader. This
helps in testing code, and is what we'll do to continue this
introduction:

.. code:: python

    vol = fr.first()
    vol




.. parsed-literal::

    <htrc_features.feature_reader.Volume at 0x1d2ffc52240>



Volume
~~~~~~

A
`Volume <http://htrc.github.io/htrc-feature-reader/htrc_features/feature_reader.m.html#htrc_features.feature_reader.Volume>`__
contains information about the current work and access to the pages of
the work. All the metadata fields from the HTRC JSON file are accessible
as properties of the volume object, including *title*, *language*,
*imprint*, *oclc*, *pubDate*, and *genre*. The main identifier *id* and
*pageCount* are also accessible, and you can find the URL for the Full
View of the text in the HathiTrust Digital Library - if it exists - with
``vol.handle_url``.

.. code:: python

    "Volume %s is a %s page text written in %s. You can doublecheck at %s" % (vol.id, vol.page_count,
                                                                              vol.language, vol.handle_url)




.. parsed-literal::

    'Volume hvd.32044010273894 is a 284 page text written in eng. You can doublecheck at http://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044010273894'



As a convenience, ``Volume.year`` returns ``Volume.pub_date``:

.. code:: python

    "%s == %s" % (vol.pub_date, vol.year)




.. parsed-literal::

    '1901 == 1901'



``Volume`` objects have an page genrator method for pages, through
``Volume.pages()``. Iterating through pages using this generator only
keeps one page at a time in memory, and again it is preferable to
reading all the pages into the list at once. Unlike volumes, your
computer can probably hold all the pages of a single volume in memory,
so it is not dire if you try to read them into a list.

Like with the ``FeatureReader``, you can also access the page generator
by iterating directly on the object (i.e. ``for page in vol``). Python
beginners may find that using ``vol.pages()`` is more clear as to what
is happening.

.. code:: python

    # Let's skip ahead some pages
    i = 0
    for page in vol:
        # Same as `for page in vol.pages()`
        i += 1
        if i >= 16:
            break
    print(page)


.. parsed-literal::

    <page 00000016 of volume hvd.32044010273894>


If you want to pass arguments to page initialization, such as changing
the page's default section from 'body' to 'group' (which returns
header+footer+body), it can be done with
``for page in vol.pages(default_section='group')``.

Finally, if the minimal metadata included with the extracted feature
files is insufficient, you can fetch the HTRC's metadata record from the
Solr Proxy with ``vol.metadata``. Remember that this calls the HTRC
servers for each volume, so can add considerable overhead.

.. code:: python

    for vol in fr.volumes():
        print(vol.metadata['published'][0])


.. parsed-literal::

    New York, and London, Harper & brothers, 1901
    London : Hurst and Blackett, 1860
    Boston ; New York : Houghton Mifflin Company, 1916 (Cambridge : The Riverside Press)
    New York, George H. Doran Company [1914]
    Chicago, New York, Scott, Foresman and company [c1919]


.. code:: python

    print("METADATA FIELDS: " + ", ".join(vol.metadata.keys()))


.. parsed-literal::

    METADATA FIELDS: _version_, htrc_charCount, title, htrc_volumePageCountBin, publishDate, title_a, mainauthor, author_only, oclc, authorSort, country_of_pub, author, htrc_gender, language, ht_id, publisher, author_top, publishDateRange, htrc_pageCount, title_top, callnosort, publication_place, topic, htsource, htrc_wordCount, title_ab, callnumber, fullrecord, htrc_volumeWordCountBin, format, lccn, genre, htrc_genderMale, topic_subject, topicStr, geographic, published, sdrnum, id


*At large-scales, using ``vol.metadata`` is an impolite and inefficient
amount of server pinging; there are better ways to query the API than
one volume at a time. Read about the `HTRC Solr
Proxy <https://wiki.htrc.illinois.edu/display/COM/Solr+Proxy+API+User+Guide>`__.*

Another source of bibliographic metadata is the HathiTrust Bib API. You
can access this information through the URL returned with
``vol.ht_bib_url``:

.. code:: python

    vol.ht_bib_url




.. parsed-literal::

    'http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/full/htid/mdp.39015028036104.json'



Volumes also have direct access to volume-wide info of features stored
in pages. For example, you can get a list of words per page through
`Volume.tokens\_per\_page() <http://htrc.github.io/htrc-feature-reader/htrc_features/feature_reader.m.html#htrc_features.feature_reader.Volume.tokens_per_page>`__.
We'll discuss these features `below <#Volume-stats-collecting>`__, after
looking first at Pages.

Pages
-----

A page contains the meat of the HTRC's extracted features, including
information for:

-  Part of speech tagged token counts, through ``Page.tokenlist()``
-  Counts of the characters occurred at the start and end of physical
   lines, though ``Page.lineCounts()``
-  Sentence counts, line counts (referring to the physical line on the
   page)
-  And more, seen in the docs for
   `Page <http://htrc.github.io/htrc-feature-reader/htrc_features/feature_reader.m.html#htrc_features.feature_reader.Page>`__

.. code:: python

    print("The body has %s lines, %s empty lines, and %s sentences" % (page.line_count(),
                                                                       page.empty_line_count(),
                                                                       page.sentence_count()))


.. parsed-literal::

    The body has 30 lines, 0 empty lines, and 9 sentences


Since the HTRC provides information by header/body/footer, most methods
take a ``section=`` argument. If not specified, this defaults to
``"body"``, or whatever argument is supplied to
``Page.default_section``.

.. code:: python

    print("%s tokens in the default section, %s" % (page.token_count(), page.default_section))
    print("%s tokens in the header" % (page.token_count(section='header')))
    print("%s tokens in the footer" % (page.token_count(section='footer')))


.. parsed-literal::

    294 tokens in the default section, body
    3 tokens in the header
    0 tokens in the footer


There are also two special arguments that can be given to ``section``:
``"all"`` and "``group``". 'all' returns information for each section
separately, when appropriate, while 'group' returns information for all
header, body, and footer combined.

.. code:: python

    print("%s tokens on the full page" % (page.token_count(section='group')))
    assert(page.token_count(section='group') == (page.token_count(section='header') +
                                                 page.token_count(section='body') + 
                                                 page.token_count(section='footer')))


.. parsed-literal::

    297 tokens on the full page


Note that for the most part, the properties of the ``Page`` and
``Volume`` objects aligns with the names in the HTRC Extracted Features
schema, except they are converted to follow `Python naming
conventions <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Naming#Naming>`__:
converting the ``CamelCase`` of the schema to
``lowercase_with_underscores``. E.g. ``beginLineChars`` from the HTRC
data is accessible as ``Page.begin_line_chars``.

The fun stuff: playing with token counts and character counts
-------------------------------------------------------------

Token counts are returned by ``Page.tokenlist()``. By default,
part-of-speech tagged, case-sensitive counts are returned for the body.

The token count information is returned as a DataFrame with a MultiIndex
(page, section, token, and part of speech) and one column (count).

.. code:: python

    print(page.tokenlist()[:3])


.. parsed-literal::

                               count
    page section token    pos       
    16   body    !        .        1
                 '        ''       1
                 'Flowers NNS      1


``Page.tokenlist()`` can be manipulated in various ways. You can
case-fold, for example:

.. code:: python

    df = page.tokenlist(case=False)
    print(df[15:18])


.. parsed-literal::

                                count
    page section lowercase pos       
    16   body    ancient   JJ       1
                 and       CC      12
                 any       DT       1


Or, you can combine part of speech counts into a single integer.

.. code:: python

    df = page.tokenlist(pos=False)
    print(df[15:18])


.. parsed-literal::

                           count
    page section token          
    16   body    Naples        1
                 November      1
                 October       1


Section arguments are valid here: 'header', 'body', 'footer', 'all', and
'group'

.. code:: python

    df = page.tokenlist(section="header", case=False, pos=False)
    print(df)


.. parsed-literal::

                            count
    page section lowercase       
    16   header  ballet         1
                 dancer         1
                 the            1


The MultiIndex makes it easy to slice the results, and it is althogether
more memory-efficient. If you are new to Pandas DataFrames, you might
find it easier to learn by converting the index to columns.

.. code:: python

    df = page.tokenlist()
    # Slicing on Multiindex: get all Signular or Mass Nouns (NN)
    idx = pd.IndexSlice
    nouns = df.loc[idx[:,:,:,'NN'],]
    print(nouns[:3])
    print("With index reset: ")
    print(nouns.reset_index()[:2])


.. parsed-literal::

                                   count
    page section token        pos       
    16   body    benefactress NN       1
                 bitterness   NN       1
                 case         NN       1
    With index reset: 
       page section         token pos  count
    0    16    body  benefactress  NN      1
    1    16    body    bitterness  NN      1


If you prefer not to use Pandas, you can always convert the object, with
methods like ``to_dict`` and ``to_csv``).

.. code:: python

    df[:3].to_dict()




.. parsed-literal::

    {'count': {(16, 'body', '!', '.'): 1,
      (16, 'body', "'", "''"): 1,
      (16, 'body', "'Flowers", 'NNS'): 1}}



To get just the unique tokens, ``Page.tokens`` provides them as a list.

.. code:: python

    page.tokens()[:7]




.. parsed-literal::

    ['!', "'", "'Flowers", "'s", ',', '.', '6']



In addition to token lists, you can also access
``Page.begin_line_chars`` and ``Section.end_line_chars``, which are
DataFrames of character counts that occur at the start or end of a line.

Volume stats collecting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Volume object has a number of methods for collecting information
from all its pages.

``Volume.tokenlist()`` works identically the page tokenlist method,
except it returns information for the full volume:

.. code:: python

    # Print case-insensitive occurrances of the word `she`
    all_vol_token_counts = vol.tokenlist(pos=False, case=False)
    print(all_vol_token_counts.loc[idx[:,'body', 'she'],][:3])


.. parsed-literal::

                            count
    page section lowercase       
    38   body    she            1
    39   body    she            1
    42   body    she            1


Note that a Volume-wide tokenlist is not crunched until you need it,
then it will stay cached in case you need it. If you try to access
``Page.tokenlist()`` *after* accessing ``Volume.tokenlist()``, the Page
object will return that page from the Volume's cached representation,
rather than preparing it itself.

``Volume.tokens()``, and ``Volume.tokens_per_page()`` give easy access
to the full vocabulary of the volume, and the token counts per page.

.. code:: python

    vol.tokens()[:10]




.. parsed-literal::

    ['"', '.', ':', 'Fred', 'Newton', 'Scott', 'gift', 'i', 'ii', 'iiiiISI']



If you prefer a DataFrame structured like a term-document matrix (where
pages are the 'documents'), ``vol.term_page_freqs()`` will return it.

By default, this returns a page-frequency rather than term-frequency,
which is to say it counts ``1`` when a term occurs on a page, regardless
of how much it occurs on that page. For a term frequency, pass
``page_freq=False``.

.. code:: python

    a = vol.term_page_freqs()
    print(a.loc[10:11,['the','and','is','he', 'she']])
    a = vol.term_page_freqs(page_freq=False)
    print(a.loc[10:11,['the','and','is', 'he', 'she']])


.. parsed-literal::

    token  the  and   is   he  she
    page                          
    10     0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
    11     1.0  1.0  1.0  0.0  0.0
    token   the  and   is   he  she
    page                           
    10      0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
    11     22.0  7.0  4.0  0.0  0.0


Volume.term\_page\_freqs provides a wide DataFrame resembling a matrix,
where terms are listed as columns, pages are listed as rows, and the
values correspond to the term frequency (or page page frequency with
``page_freq=true``). Volume.term\_volume\_freqs() simply sums these.

Multiprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For faster processing, you can write a mapping function for acting on
volumes, then pass it to ``FeatureReader.multiprocessing``. This sends
out the function to a different process per volume, spawning
(CPU\_CORES-1) processes at a time. The map function receives the
feature\_reader and a volume path as a tuple, and needs to initialize
the volume.

Here's a simple example that returns the term counts for each volume
(take note of the first two lines of the function):

.. code:: python

    def printTokenList(args):
        fr, path = args
        vol = fr.create_volume(path)
        return ('tokens', vol.tokens)

    fr  = FeatureReader(paths)
    all_tokens = []
    mapper = fr.multiprocessing(printTokenList)
    for key, result in mapper:
        all_tokens = all_tokens + result
    set(all_tokens)

Some rules: results must be serializeable, and the map\_func must be
accessible from **main** (basically: no dynamic functions: they should
be written plainly in your script).

The results are collected and returned together, so you don't want a
feature reader with all 4.8 million files, because the results will be
too much memory (depending on how big your result is). Instead, it
easier to initialize feature readers for smaller batches.

GNU Parallel
^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an alternative to multiprocessing in Python, my preference is to have
simpler Python scripts and to use GNU Parallel on the command line. To
do this, you can set up your Python script to take variable length
arguments of feature file paths, and to print to stdout.

This psuedo-code shows how that you'd use parallel, where the number of
parallel processes is 90% the number of cores, and 50 paths are sent to
the script at a time (if you send too little at a time, the
initialization time of the script can add up).

.. code:: bash

    find feature-files/ -name '*json.bz2' | parallel --eta --jobs 90% -n 50 python your_script.py >output.txt

Additional Notes
----------------

Installing the development version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    git clone https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader.git
    cd htrc-feature-reader
    python setup.py install

Iterating through the JSON files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to do fast, highly customized processing without
instantiating Volumes, FeatureReader has a convenient generator for
getting the raw JSON as a Python dict: ``fr.jsons()``. This simply does
the file reading, optional decompression, and JSON parsing.

Downloading files within the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``utils`` includes an Rsyncing utility, ``download_file``. This requires
Rsync to be installed on your system.

**Usage:**

Download one file to the current directory:

::

    utils.download_file(htids='nyp.33433042068894')

Download multiple files to the current directory:

::

    ids = ['nyp.33433042068894', 'nyp.33433074943592', 'nyp.33433074943600']
    utils.download_file(htids=ids)

Download file to ``/tmp``:

::

    utils.download_file(htids='nyp.33433042068894', outdir='/tmp')

Download file to current directory, keeping pairtree directory
structure, i.e.
``./nyp/pairtree_root/33/43/30/42/06/88/94/33433042068894/nyp.33433042068894.json.bz2``:

``utils.download_file(htids='nyp.33433042068894', keep_dirs=True)``

Getting the Rsync URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a HathiTrust Volume ID and want to be able to download the
features for a specific book, ``hrtc_features.utils`` contains an
`id\_to\_rsync <http://htrc.github.io/htrc-feature-reader/htrc_features/utils.m.html#htrc_features.utils.id_to_rsync>`__
function. This uses the `pairtree <http://pythonhosted.org/Pairtree/>`__
library but has a fallback written with that library is not installed,
since it isn't compatible with Python 3.

.. code:: python

    from htrc_features import utils
    utils.id_to_rsync('miun.adx6300.0001.001')

See the `ID to Rsync notebook <examples/ID_to_Rsync_Link.ipynb>`__ for
more information on this format and on Rsyncing lists of urls.

There is also a command line utility installed with the HTRC Feature
Reader:

.. code:: bash

    $ htid2rsync miun.adx6300.0001.001
    miun/pairtree_root/ad/x6/30/0,/00/01/,0/01/adx6300,0001,001/miun.adx6300,0001,001.json.bz2

Advanced Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the beta Extracted Features release, schema 2.0, a few features were
separated out to an advanced files. However, *this designation is no
longer present starting with schema 3.0*, meaning information like
``beginLineChars``, ``endLineChars``, and ``capAlphaSeq`` are always
available:

.. code:: python

    # What is the longest sequence of capital letter on each page?
    vol.cap_alpha_seqs()[:10]




.. parsed-literal::

    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1]



.. code:: python

    end_line_chars = vol.end_line_chars()
    print(end_line_chars.head())


.. parsed-literal::

                             count
    page section place char       
    2    body    end   -         1
                       :         1
                       I         1
                       f         1
                       t         1


.. code:: python

    # Find pages that have lines ending with "!"
    idx = pd.IndexSlice
    print(end_line_chars.loc[idx[:,:,:,'!'],].head())


.. parsed-literal::

                             count
    page section place char       
    45   body    end   !         1
    75   body    end   !         1
    77   body    end   !         1
    91   body    end   !         1
    92   body    end   !         1
