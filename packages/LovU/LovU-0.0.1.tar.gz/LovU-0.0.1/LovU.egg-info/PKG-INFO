        About Project:

        # How to Use
        
        LoveU supports two different mode : offline mode and online mode.
        
        * Offline mode : Uses only the offline resourses rather than using a google translate to generate a “I love you” sentense.
        * Online mode : Uses google translate to generate a “I love you” sentense and uses it in this project. However this seems to be much acc urate in some times, but requires some other extra libraries and network connection.
