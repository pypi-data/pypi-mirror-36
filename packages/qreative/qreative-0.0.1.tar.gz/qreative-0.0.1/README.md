# Creative Quantumness

Quantum computers have been used for creative projects. These tools are based on some of these projects, and are designed to make it easier to do similar things in future.

Examples of how to use these tools can be found in [this jupyter notebook](how-to-use.ipynb).

### Projects on which the current tools are based
