Process Engine
=====

Process Engine is used in conjunction with celery to create async process from
celery tasks via an API


Quick start
-----------

1. Add "processengine" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'processengine',
    ]

2. Include the router URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

    from processengine.api import router as process_router
    ...

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^processengine/', include(process_router.urls)),
        ...
    ]

3. Add the PROCESS_MAP settings with your processes and the tasks to run like
so::

    PROCESS_MAP = {
        'my.process': [
            'path.to.taskfile.task',
        ],
        ...
    }

3. (Optional) Add settings for Slack Notifications. Note that it is an error to add a SLACK_WEBHOOK setting without also having the other settings below present.::
  SLACK_WEBHOOK = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T051CQH14/VWVRAAFA5/lPz2y84gM0JUoVllBow0Glcx"
  SLACK_PROCESS_CHANNEL = "#Processes"
  SLACK_PROCESS_USERNAME = "Someuser"
  SLACK_PROCESS_EMOJI = ":ghost:"
  SERVICE_NAME = "Someservice"

4. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the processengine models.

5. to create a process run a POST to http://127.0.0.1:8000/processengine/process/
with the following data::

    data = {
        name: "my.process", # This is the name of your process set in PROCESS_MAP variable
        context: {
            "name": "value" # This is the data that you pass through to your task
        }
    }

Note: Your tasks need to conform to the pattern of json in and json out
