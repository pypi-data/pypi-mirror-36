Zou is the memory of your CG production
---------------------------------------

Zou is an API that allows to store and manage the data of your CG
production. Through it you can link all the tools of your pipeline and
make sure they are all synchronized. 

To integrate it quickly in your tools you can rely on the dedicated
Python client named `Gazu <https://gazu.cg-wire.com>`__.

Features
~~~~~~~~

Zou can:

-  Store production data: projects, shots, assets, tasks, files metadata
   and validations.
-  Provide folder and file paths for any task.
-  Data import from Shotgun or CSV files.
-  Export main data to CSV files.
-  Provide helpers to manage task workflow (start, publish, retake).
-  Listen to events to plug external modules on it.

Installation and documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation of Zou itself is pretty straightforward but it requires the
setup of third-parties tool like a database instance. So we recommend
you to jump directly to the full documentation:
