D-Genies
--------

Dot plots are widely used to quickly compare sequence sets. They provide a synthetic similarity overview, highlighting repetitions, breaks and inversions. Different tools have been developed to easily generated genomic alignment dot plots, but they are often limited in the input sequence size. D-GENIES is a standalone and WEB application performing large genome alignments using [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) software package and generating interactive dot plots. It enables users to sort query sequences along the reference , zoom in the plot and download several image, alignment or sequence files. D-GENIES is an easy to install open source software package (GPL) developed in Python and JavaScript.

How to use?
