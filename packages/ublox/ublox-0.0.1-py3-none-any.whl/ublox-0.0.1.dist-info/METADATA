Python library for U-blox cellular modules.

Installation
============

Python version supported: 3.6+

.. code-block::

    pip install ublox


About
=====

The ublox library gives a python interface to AT Commands via serial interface
to Ublox modules. This can used for testing and profiling of modules and
technologies or you might want to hook up a small python program to send data
over NB-IoT.

Supported Modules
=================

* SARA-N211
* SARA-R412

Development
===========

The library is currently used for testing infrastructure in Sweden and are somewhat
hardcoded to that. We will make an effort to remove hardcoded values and have a
more unified API around the control of the modules.

If you have special need there is always the possibility to used the lower
level API for AT Commands.

If you have use-cases that could be solved with more options on functions, make
the change yourself and open a pull request or open an issue.
