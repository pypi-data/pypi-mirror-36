1. Go to the `geckodriver releases
   page <https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases>`__. Find the
   latest version of the driver for the ARM platform and download it.
   For example:

   ::

       wget https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.18.0/geckodriver-v0.18.0-linux64.tar.gz

2. Extract the file with:

   ::

       tar -xvzf geckodriver*

3. Make it executable:

   ::

       chmod +x geckodriver

4. Add the driver to your PATH so other tools can find it:

   ::

       echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$PWD/geckodriver" >> .bashrc
