A Python library for solution chemistry
=======================================

pyEQL is a Python library that provides tools for modeling aqueous electrolyte
solutions. It allows the user to manipulate solutions as Python
objects, providing methods to populate them with solutes, calculate 
species-specific properties (such as activity and diffusion coefficients),
and retreive bulk properties (such as density, conductivity, or volume).

---

pyEQL is designed to be customizable and easy to integrate into projects 
that require modeling of chemical thermodyanmics of aqueous solutions.
It aspires to provide a flexible, extensible framework for the user, with a 
high level of transparency about data sources and calculation methods. 

pyEQL runs on Python 3.0+ and is licensed under LGPL.

Key Features
------------

- Build accurate solution properties using a minimum of inputs. Just specify
  the identity and quantity of a solute and pyEQL will do the rest.
  
- "Graceful Decay" from more sophisticated, data-intensive modeling approaches 
  to simpler, less accurate ones depending on the amount of data supplied. 

- Not limited to dilute solutions. pyEQL contains out of the box support for 
  the Pitzer Model and other methods for modeling concentrated solutions.
  
- Extensible database system that allows one to supplement pyEQL's default
  parameters with project-specific data.

- Units-aware calculations (by means of the [pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint) library)
