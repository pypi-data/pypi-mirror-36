Description: Pylatest project consists of set of Docutils/Sphinx extensions and related
        tools which allows you to:
        
        * Write a description of a test case using reStructuredText syntax.
        * Maintain test case description as Sphinx project.
        * Include this description into a python source code directly, where it can
          be split into individual sections or actions to be performed, so that the
          description and test automation code are stored next to each other.
        
        The reason behind this is to make synchronization between automatic test cases
        and test case description documents simple while keeping the maintenance cost
        low in the long term.
