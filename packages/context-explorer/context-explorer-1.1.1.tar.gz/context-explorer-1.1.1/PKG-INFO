        # ContextExplorer
        
        ContextExplorer facilitates analyses and visualization of data extracted from
        microscope images of cells.
        
        ## Relevance
        
        The analyses methods in ContextExplorer focuses on how populations of cells are
        affected by their microenvironment, including local variations in cell
        signalling and cell density. It is currently difficult for scientists without
        previous programming experience to quantify these variables, although it is
        relevant for many research areas. Facilitating this type of analyses can help
        scientists around the world to improve their understanding of cellular behavior
        and accelerate their research.
        
        ## Overview
        
        ![Workflow overview](doc/img/fig1-overview.png)
        
        ContextExplorer is controlled via a graphical user interface and aims to enable
        powerful analysis and visualizations of single cell data extracted from
        microscope images for a broad scientific audience. ContextExplorer can
        work in tandem with many other tools since it only depends on a correctly
        formatted CSV-file as input and only outputs commonly used file formats (`.csv`,
        `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.pdf`)
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ContextExplorer can be installed via the package managers `conda` or `pip`. The
        recommended way is to use `conda`:
        
        1. Download and install the [Anaconda Python
           distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (version 3.x). This is an
           easy way to install Python and gives access to the powerful package manager
           `conda`.
        2. If you are using Windows, open up the `Anaconda Prompt` from the start menu.
           On MacOS and Linux you can use your default terminal (e.g. `terminal.app` on
           MacOS).
        3. Type `conda install -c joelostblom context_explorer` and press return.
        
        ## Using ContextExplorer
        
        If you are new to ContextExplorer, first download [the sample
        data](https://gitlab.com/stemcellbioengineering/context-explorer/raw/master/sample-data/ce-sample.csv)
        (right click link -> Save as). Launch ContextExplorer by typing
        `context_explorer` in the terminal/`Anaconda Prompt`, then choose the sample file
        (or your own data) from the file selector. That's all you need to start testing
        ContextExplorer!
        
        Detailed documentation and workflow examples are available at the [documentation
        page](http://contextexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
