        ===================
        visaplan.plone.base
        ===================
        
        This package simply collects some basic constants etc. (e.g. permission names)
        which are used by other packages, e.g. ``visaplan.plone.browsers``.
        
        It is part of the footing of the "Unitracc family" of Plone sites
        which are maintained by visaplan GmbH, Bochum, Germany.
        
        Some parts of this package might be outdated now and not anymore considered to
        follow Plone's current Best Practices.  The reason is:
        
        The purpose of this package (for now) is *not* to provide new functionality
        but to factor out existing functionality from our former monolithic Zope product.
        Later versions might reflect more recent insights and/or the requirements of
        more recent Zope/Plone versions.
        
        This package does still contain some resources (e.g. permission names) which
        are specific to our "Unitracc family" of sites; thus, we considere it more
        likely you to create your own *yourcompany*.plone.base fork than to use this
        package directly.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - ``exceptions`` module
        
          - Provides the ``UnitraccBaseException`` class which supports the
            localization of error messages which are presented to the users
        
          - Some more exception classes.
        
        - ``permissions`` module
        
          Imports some permission names from the Zope/Plone packages,
          and adds some proprietary permission names from our "Unitracc family".
        
        - ``typestr`` module
        
          Creates dictionaries for the localization (l10n) of strings related to object
          type names; e.g., for your portal_type ``thingy`` you might want a Gettext
          message id ``thingies``, and perhaps as well ``My thingies`` and others.
        
          When calles as a script, the module creates a honeypot file for use by
          extraction tools.
        
        - ``adapter`` module
        
          A "Base" class for the adapters of ``visaplan.plone.adapters``
          which saves the ``context`` (given during adapter creation) to an attribute
          and calls (probably for historical reasons) the ``reference_catalog`` tool
          (this may change in the future).
        
        - the ``browserview`` module
        
          Provides an extended version of the ``Products.Five.BrowserView``
          (hwich may as well change in the future).
