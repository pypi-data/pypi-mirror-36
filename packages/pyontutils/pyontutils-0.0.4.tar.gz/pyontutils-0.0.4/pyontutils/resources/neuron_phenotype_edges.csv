hasExpressionPhenotype,"MolecularConstituents, Neurotransmitter/NeurotransmitterReceptors",,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a gene type. This should be used for detection of RNAs that code for proteins which may or may not have been detected directly.,,,hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasNeurotransmitterPhenotype,Neurotransmitter,,,,not entirely sure if we need this one,hasExpressionPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasMorphologicalPhenotype,"SpineDensityOnDendrites, CellSomaSize, CellSomaShape",,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a morphological phenotype concept. This should be used when a neuron type is described using a high level morphological concept class.,,,hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasDendriteMorphologicalPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron and a dendrite phenotype. This should be used when a neuron type is described by the morphology of its dendrites.,,,hasMorphologicalPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"

hasDevelopmentalOrigin,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a developmental cell population. This should be used when a neuron develops from an identified developmental cell population.,needs work,,hasPhenotype,,
#intrinsic/extrinsic phenotypes,,,,,,,,
#hasExtrinsicPhenotype,,,,,,hasPhenotype,,
hasProjectionPhenotype,Has role,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a brain region that said neuron type sends axons to.,,"this might be clearer than hasCircuitRole but might confuse with projectsTo or the like, excitatory/inhibitory shouldn't be handled here? The way that projection vs intrinsic is modelled relates whether axons leave the brain region that contains the soma or not, this is not fully modelled at the moment",hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasLayerLocationPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a laminar brain region.,,"May need hasSomaLayerLocation or something, do we really even need this?? if axioms are missing in parcellation schemes and uberon then it should be easy enough to add them, or at least we won't get disjointness issues because layers of cortex are orthogonal to parts of cortex (eg) and thus we shouldnt get reasoning errors",hasLocationPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasLocationPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a brain region or brain parcel. This is a superProperty and should not be used directly.,,,hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"

hasExperimentalPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron and an experimental condition. This should be used when a neuron type is described by some experimental condition or functional designation.,,This needs a better name. It is clear what it means when you see examples of the usage.,hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"

hasInstanceInSpecies,Species/taxa,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a species. This should be used when a neuron type has been observed in a specific species.,,,hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasTaxonRank,Species/taxa,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a taxon. This should be used when a neuron type is thought to have been present in the last common ancestor of the taxon.,,isAncestralInTaxon (because convergent evolution is SOOO likely…),hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
,,,,,,,,
phenotypeObservedInBrainRegion,,Located in?,Expresses a relationship between a phenotype and a brain region. This should be used when a neuron phenotype is observed in specific brain regions.,,existential not universal,,,
phenotypeCooccuresWith,,,Expresses a relationship between a phenotype and a phenotype. This should be used when two phenotypes commonly cooccure.,,"this is not the right way to pull this off, need something akin to disjointness",,,
