# Neuron Models
Put the python code to generate sets of neurons here.

If there are additional files that need to be version controlled
put them in `../resources/` and use `__file__` as the base to access
them.

# Additional models tracked elsewhere
1. Import from NeuroLex [lift_neuron_triples.py](https://github.com/tgbugs/nlxeol/blob/master/lift_neuron_triples.py). Run [process_csv.py](https://github.com/tgbugs/nlxeol/blob/master/process_csv.py) first.
