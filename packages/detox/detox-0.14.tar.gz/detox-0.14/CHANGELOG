0.11.0
-----------------------

- #406: Add support for running detox as python -m detox
  Thanks André Caron (@AndreLouisCaron).

- (infrastructure) add Travis CI setup.
  Thanks Timothée Mazzucotelli (@Pawamoy).

- add "-n NUMPROC" option to set number of processes.  The default
  is the number of CPUs as determined by multiprocessing.cpu_count()
  or "2" if the call does not work (e.g. on py27/windows).
  Thanks Timothée Mazzucotelli (@Pawamoy).


0.10.0

0.9.4
-----------------------

- get compatible again to eventlet by avoiding to import
  eventlet.processes, thanks Takeshi Komiya for the PR.

- make detox honor skipsdist.  Thanks Timoth Messier for the PR.

- change license to MIT

0.9.3
-----------------------

- fix issue6: quickly make detox work with tox-1.6 again (although not all 1.6 features
  supported, e.g. --develop does not work)

- fix issue3: don't claim a TROVE identifier of "python3" because detox
  itself depends on eventlet which does not work on py3 yet. (Nevertheless
  detox will create py3 environments through tox of course)

- fix issue1: support python2.5 again (although we might drop it in the
  future -- it's enough of tox/detox can _create_ and handle py25 environments,
  they don't neccessarily need to support running themselv on py25)

- fix issue4 - fail properly if sdist-packaging fails

0.9.1
-----------------------
