Description: # pyclick
        This is a library for generating human-like mouse movements.
        The movements are based on the concept of bezier curve:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve
        
        ### Simple Example:
        ```
        from pyclick import HumanClicker
        
        # initialize HumanClicker object
        hc = HumanClicker()
        
        # move the mouse to position (100,100) on the screen in approximately 2 seconds
        hc.move((100,100),2)
        
        # mouse click(left button)
        hc.click()
        ```
        You can also customize the mouse curve by passing a HumanCurve to HumanClicker. You can control:
        - number of internal knots, to change the overall shape of the curve,
        - distortion to simulate shivering,
        - tween to simulate acceleration and speed of movement
