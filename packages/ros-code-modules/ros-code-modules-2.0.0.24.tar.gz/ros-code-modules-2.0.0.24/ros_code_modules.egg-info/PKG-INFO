Description: Thank you for installing the modules of ROS Code.
        The installation adds [these](https://github.com/Richienb/ROS-Code/tree/master/min/ros) ([view unminified](https://github.com/Richienb/ROS-Code/tree/master/src/ros)) files in a folder called `ros` in your Python `site-packages` directory.
        You can use any commands exposed in that directory
        
        #### Here's an example:
        
        This is how you'd **normally** check if a number is a prime one.
        You'd have to create a new function and add a docstring so Python will recognize it when a user executes the `pydoc` command.
        Then you'll need to ask for the user's input and execute the command.
        
        ```python
        def isprime(number):
            """
        
            Check if a number is a prime number
        
            number:
            The number to check
        
            """
        
            if number == 1:
                return False
            for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
                if number % i == 0:
                    return False
            return True
        
        if isprime(input("Enter a number to check for prime: ")):
          print("It is prime!")
        else:
          print("It isn't prime!")
        ```
        
        With **ROS Code**, you can simplify this task:
        
        ```python
        from ros.main import isprime
        
        if isprime(input("Enter a number to check for prime: ")):
          print("It is prime!")
        else:
          print("It isn't prime!")
        ```
        
        You can **find more tasks** which you can simplify related to maths, strings and more [here](https://github.com/Richienb/ROS-Code/tree/master/src/ros).
