HSPICE simulator interface
==========================

This demo shows how to use the HSPICE simulator interface. 

Read chapter :ref:`tut-evaluation-spiceopus` to learn about the circuit and its 
description. The file names are the same as in the SPICE OPUS example, except 
that the files are using the HSPICE syntax.
