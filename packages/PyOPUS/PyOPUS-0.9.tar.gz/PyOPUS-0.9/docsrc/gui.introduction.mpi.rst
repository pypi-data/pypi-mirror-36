MPI hosts tab
=============

The MPI hosts tab can be opened by selecting View/MPI hosts in the main menu. 
There is only one such tab. The settings eneterd in this tab are stored in the 
``pyopusgui.config`` file. Here you can define the computers that will be 
running your tasks and allocate the desired number of processors on every 
listed computer. The right part of the table displays the running tasks and 
the number of CPUs allocated to individual tasks.
