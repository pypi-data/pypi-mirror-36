Results database tabs
=====================

The results database display tab for the active task can be opened by selecting 
Task/View results in the main menu. These tabs can be closed. They display 
the contents of a results database. They also makes it possible to plot 
waveforms and evaluate performance measures from the results saved by the 
evaluator (postprocessing of results).

At the top the path to the results database and the timepoint when it was 
created are displayed. The rest of the tab is divided horizontally in three 
parts

   * Tree with the result nodes (left)
   * The available aspects of the active result node along with the  
     lists of performance measures and plots available in the postprocessing 
     step (middle)
   * The contents of the active result node's selected aspect (right). 
     If a performance measure or a plot are selected in the middle part of the 
     tab then the respective postprocessing measure/plot can be edited and the 
     results of the evaluation/plotting are displayed here.
