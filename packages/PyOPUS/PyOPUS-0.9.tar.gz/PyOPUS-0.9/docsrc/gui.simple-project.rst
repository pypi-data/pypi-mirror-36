Setting up a project
====================

Here we are going to demonstrate how you can set up a simple project 
which is the basis for evaluation of a circuit's performance. As the 
circuit we are going to use a Miller opamp. All of the project files 
can be found in `demo/gui/miller/ <../../../demo/gui/miller/>`_
The project file is named ``miller.pog``.
