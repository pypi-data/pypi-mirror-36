optimizely-cli
==============

optimizely-cli is a command-line interface for Optimizely projects.

It aims to give you quick access to your experiment data as well as store a
local copy of your data so that you can manage and track changes in the version
control system of your choice.

-------------------
System Requirements
-------------------

optimizely-cli runs on Linux and Mac OS X, and requires Python 2.7.x+. It may
work on other versions of Python.

------------
Installation
------------

Install or upgrade optimizely-cli using pip:

    $ pip install --upgrade optimizely-cli

If you get some sort of error about TLS versions like this:

    "There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION]"

Then install a newer version of pip and then install again:

    $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python

---------------
Getting Started
---------------

To use optimizely-cli, you need to link it to your Optimizely account.
The quickest way to get started is to run the ``opti init`` command and follow
the instructions::

    $ opti init
	First visit https://app.optimizely.com/v2/profile/api to create a new access token
	Enter the token you created here:
	Verifying token...
	Token is valid
	Credentials written to .optimizely-credentials.json
	Do not add this file to version control!
	It should stay private

	Checking for an existing project...
	Successfully created project (id: <project_id>)
	Config file written to .optimizely.json

You can move ``.optimizely-credentials.json`` to your home directory (the
``opti`` tool will look there as long as your project is under your home):

	$ mv .optimizely-credentials.json ~/

Or add it to your .gitignore file like this:

	$ echo .optimizely-credentials.json >> .gitignore

Don't commit your credentials to version control!
