### Python modules for SBtab ###

Data tables in the form of spreadsheets or delimited text files are the most utilised data format in
Systems Biology. However, they are often not sufficiently structured and lack clear naming conventions
that would be required for modelling. We propose the SBtab format as an attempt to establish an
easy-to-use table format that is both flexible and clearly structured. It comprises defined table types
for different kinds of data; syntax rules for usage of names, shortnames, and database identifiers used
for annotation; and standardised formulae for reaction stoichiometries. Predefined table types can be
used to define biochemical network models and the biochemical constants therein. The user can also
define own table types, adjusting SBtab to other types of data. Software code, tools, and further
information can be found at www.sbtab.net.

The included Python modules can be loaded and utilised within programming projects or via commandline.
