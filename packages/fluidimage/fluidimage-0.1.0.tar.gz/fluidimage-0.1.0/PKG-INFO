        FluidImage is a libre Python framework for scientific treatments of large
        series of images. This package is very young but it is already mature enough to
        be used "in production" to
        
        - pre-process images,
        - compute `Particle Image Velocimetry
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_image_velocimetry (PIV)>`_ (PIV,
          i.e. displacements of pattern obtained by correlations of cropped images),
        - analyze PIV fields.
        
        We want to make FluidImage easy (useful documentation, easy installation,
        usable with scripts and GUI in Qt), reliable (with good `unittests
        <https://codecov.io/bb/fluiddyn/fluidimage/>`_) and very efficient, in
        particular when the number of images to treat becomes large. Thus we want
        FluidImage to be able to run efficiently and easily on a personal computer and
        on big clusters. The efficiency is achieved by using
        
        - an asynchronous framework (and in the long term we want to be able to plug
          FluidImage to distributed computational systems like `Storm
          <http://storm.apache.org/>`_),
        - the available cores of the central processing units (CPU) and the available
          graphics processing units (GPU),
        - good profiling and efficient and specialized algorithms,
        - cutting-edge tools for fast computations with Python (in particular `Pythran
          <https://pythonhosted.org/pythran/>`_ and `Theano
          <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano>`_).
