Please change the following files according to your needs:

* delivery.yaml: change environment variables and Docker image - both in
                 'dependencies' section and 'IMAGE' environment. Remove the
                 'autostat_on_update' field if you wish to trigger CDP whenever
                 the Docker image gets update.
* deploy/apply/ingress-template.yaml: check and modify the DNS name (if needed).
