Description: SROMPy - **S**tochastic **R**educed **O**rder **M**odels with **Py**thon 
        ==========================================================================
        
        Python module for generating Stochastic Reduced Order Models (SROMs) and applying them for uncertainty quantification problems. See documentation in docs/ directory for details. 
        
        Example usage:
        
        ```python
        from postprocess import Postprocessor
        from srom import SROM
        from target import NormalRandomVariable
        
        #Initialize Normal random variable object to be modeled by SROM:
        normal = NormalRandomVariable(mean=3., std_dev=1.5)
        
        #Initialize SROM & optimize to model the normal random variable:
        srom = SROM(size=10, dim=1)
        srom.optimize(normal)
        
        #Compare the CDF of the SROM & target normal variable:
        pp = Postprocessor(srom, normal)
        pp.compare_CDFs()
        ```
          
        The above code snippet produces the following CDF comparison plot:
