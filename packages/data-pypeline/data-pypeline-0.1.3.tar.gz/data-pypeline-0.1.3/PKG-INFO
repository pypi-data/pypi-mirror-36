Description: # Pypeline
        
        This is a package for creating iterative data processing pipelines. Note that
        this is NOT a general purpose stream processing library. It is only designed as 
        being a low overhead and simple-to-setup stream processing library. So for
        large scale production applications, use something like kafka instead.
        
        ## Warning
        This library is still at an ALPHA stage. So things may not work as intended
        and the api is not final!
        
        ## Trivial Example
        ```python
        from pypeline import build_action, Pypeline, ForkingPypelineExecutor, wrap
        import asyncio
        
        async def step1():
            results = []
            for i in range(1000):
                results.append(wrap(i))
            return results
        
        async def step2(i):
            return i * 10
            
        async def step3(i):
            return i + 1
        
        async def run_pipeline():
            pypeline = Pypeline()
            # Adding actions to the pipeline
            pypeline.add_action(build_action("Step1", step1)) \ 
                    .add_action(build_action("Step2", step2)) \
                    .add_action(build_action("Step3", step3, serialize_dir="./example"))  # Serialize results so future runs will skip this step entirely
            results = await pypeline.run(executor=ForkingPypelineExecutor())  # Custom executor that avoids the GIL
            # Results are wrapped in a utility namedtuple, so let's flatten it.
            results = [r.args[0] for r in results]
            return results
            
        results = asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(run_pipeline())
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```
