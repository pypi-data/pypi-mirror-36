Description: # LiquPy: Open-source Python Library for Soil Liquefaction and Lateral Spread Analysis
        ## https://github.com/LiquPy/LiquPy
        
        This open-source Python library is an attempt to facilitate research on soil liquefaction and lateral spreads by providing researchers/engineers with premade/verified Python codes.

        ### What is included?
        So far the following methods have been added:
          - under "Analysis_on_boreholes.py":
            - Simplified factor of safety for triggering of soil liquefaction based on Idriss & Boulanger (2008)
            - Lateral Displacement Index (LDI) and settlement (Zhang et al. 2004)
          - under "Analysis_on_points.py":
            - Multi Linear Regression (MLR) (Youd, Hansen, & Bartlett 2002)
            - Multi Linear Regression (MLR) (Bardet et al. 2002)
            - Genetic programming (Javadi et al. 2006)
            - Evolutionary-based approach (Rezania et al. 2011)
            - Artificial Neural Network & Genetic Algorithm (Baziar & Azizkani 2013) *Read below
            - Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) (Goh et al. 2014) *Read below
        
        ### What is not verified yet?
        Use of the following functions of our library is not recommended since their results differ from what is given in their original papers; please note it does not mean these models are incorrect. However, we were unable to replicate them in this library and therefore would not recommend using these functions of our library:
          - under "Analysis_on_points.py":
            - Baziar2013()
            - Goh()
        
        
        ### Dependencies:
        Python (>= 3.5)
        
        Also, if you are not installing LiquPy through `pip install LiquPy`,  install the following Python dependencies before using these codes:
         - numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
         - pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
         - sklearn (https://scikit-learn.org)
         - matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
