Bid on '.eth' ENS names with Python
===================================

|Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ens-py/Lobby|

Access the Ethereum Name Service Auction using this python library.
Note: **this is a work in progress**

Using this library is not a way to skip learning how ENS works. If you
are registering a name, a small misunderstanding can cause you to lose
**all** your deposit. Go `read about
ENS <http://docs.ens.domains/en/latest/userguide.html>`__ first. Your
funds are your responsibility.

Beta-quality warning
--------------------

This is a preview for developers, and an invitation for contributions.
Please do not use this in production until this warning is removed,
especially when putting funds at risk. Examples of funds being at risk
include: sending ether/tokens to resolved addresses and participating in
name auctions.

If you supply the a domain with type ``bytes``, it will be assumed to be
UTF-8 encoded, like in `Ethereum
contracts <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI#argument-encoding>`__.

Setup
-----

::

    pip install ensauction

Any issues? See `Setup details <#setup-details>`__

Usage
-----

All examples in Python 3

Auctions for names ending in .eth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get auction status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example with domain 'payment.eth':

.. code:: py

    from ensauction.auto import ethnames
    from ensauction.registrar import Status

    status = ethnames.status('payment.eth')

| If you get an error here, like: > UnhandledRequest: No providers
  responded to the RPC request:
| method:eth\_getBlockByNumber
| params:['latest', False]

Then you are not connected to your node. See below `how to manually
connect to your node <#optionally-a-custom-web3-provider>`__.

Otherwise, continue...

.. code:: py

    # if you forget to strip out .eth, ens.py will do it for you
    assert ethnames.status('payment') == status

    # these are the possible statuses

    assert status in (
      Status.Open,
      Status.Auctioning,
      Status.Owned,
      Status.Forbidden,
      Status.Revealing,
      Status.NotYetAvailable
      )


    # if you get the integer status from another source, you can compare it directly

    assert Status.Owned == 2

Start auctions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: py

    # start one auction (which tips people off that you're interested)

    ethnames.start('you_saw_him_repressin_me_didnt_ya')


    # start many auctions (which provides a bit of cover)

    ethnames.start(['exchange', 'tickets', 'payment', 'trading', 'registry'])

Bid on auction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bid on a 'trading.eth' with 5211 ETH, and secret "I promise I will not
forget my secret":

.. code:: py

    from web3.auto import w3

    ethnames.bid(
          'trading',
          Web3.toWei('5211', 'ether'),
          "I promise I will not forget my secret",
          transact={'from': w3.eth.accounts[0]}
          )

(if you want to "mask" your bid, set a higher value in the transact
dict)

Reveal your bid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You must **always** reveal your bid, whether you won or lost. Otherwise
you will lose the full deposit.

Example of revealing your bid on 'registry.eth' with 0.01 ETH, and
secret "For real, though: losing your secret means losing ether":

.. code:: py

    ethnames.reveal(
          'registry',
          Web3.toWei('0.01', 'ether'),
          "For real, though: losing your secret means losing ether",
          transact={'from': w3.eth.accounts[0]}
          )

Claim the name you won
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

aka "Finalize" auction, which makes you the owner in ENS.

.. code:: py

    ethnames.finalize('gambling')

Get detailed information on an auction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find out the owner of the auction Deed -- see `docs on the
difference <http://docs.ens.domains/en/latest/userguide.html#managing-ownership>`__
between owning the name and the deed

.. code:: py

    deed = ethnames.deed('ethfinex')

    assert deed.owner() == '0x9A02ed4Ca9AD55b75fF9A05DeBb36D5eb382E184'

When was the auction completed? (a timezone-aware datetime object)

.. code:: py

    close_datetime = ethnames.close_at('ethfinex')

    assert str(close_datetime) == '2017-06-05 08:10:03+00:00'

How much is held on deposit?

.. code:: py

    from decimal import Decimal
    from web3 import Web3

    deposit = ethnames.deposit('ethfinex')

    assert Web3.fromWei(deposit, 'ether') == Decimal('0.01')

What was the highest bid?

.. code:: py

    top_bid = ethnames.top_bid('ethfinex')

    assert Web3.fromWei(top_bid, 'ether') == Decimal('201709.02')

Setup details
-------------

If Python 2 is your default, or you're not sure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your shell

::

    if pip --version | grep "python 2"; then
      python3 -m venv ~/.py3venv
      source ~/.py3venv/bin/activate
    fi

Now, with Python 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your shell: ``pip install ensauction``

*ensauction.py* requires an up-to-date Ethereum blockchain, preferably
local. If your setup isn't working, try running ``geth --fast`` until
it's fully-synced. I highly recommend using the default IPC
communication method, for speed and security.

"No matching distribution found for ensauction"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are seeing something like:

::

    Collecting ensauction
      Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement ensauction (from versions: )
    No matching distribution found for ensauction

It is most likely that you are in Python 2. Retry the first Setup
section, to make sure you're in Python 3

Use a custom web3 provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Python:

::

    from ensauction.registrar import Registrar
    from ens import ENS
    from web3 import IPCProvider 

    ns = ENS(IPCProvider('/your/custom/ipc/path'))
    reg = Registrar(ns)

Developer Setup
---------------

::

    git clone git@github.com:carver/ensauction.py.git
    cd ensauction.py/

    python3 -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate

    pip install -e .
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Testing Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Re-run flake on file changes:

::

    $ when-changed -s -1 -r ensauction/ tests/ -c "clear; echo; echo \"running flake - $(date)\"; warn()
    {
    notify-send -t 5000 'Flake8 failure ⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠' 'flake8 on ensauction.py failed'
    }
    if ! git diff | flake8 --diff | grep "\.py"; then if ! flake8 ensauction/ tests/; then warn; fi else warn; fi; echo done"

Why does ensauction.py require python 3?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Short version*

It turns out that the distinction between ``str`` and ``bytes`` is
important. If you want to write code for the future (Ethereum), don't
use a language from the past.

*Long version*

Interacting with the EVM requires clarity on the bits you're using. For
example, a sha3 hash expects to receive a series of bytes to process.
Calculating the sha3 hash of a string is (or should be) a Type Error;
the hash algorithm doesn't know what to do with a series of characters,
aka Unicode code points. As the caller, you need to know which thing
you're calculating the hash of: 1. a series of bytes:
``b'[ c$o!\x91\xf1\x8f&u\xce\xdb\x8b(\x10.\x95tX'`` 2. the bytes
represented by a string in hex format:
``'0x5b2063246f2191f18f2675cedb8b28102e957458'`` 3. the bytes generated
by encoding a string using utf-8: **Oops, the bytes from #1 cannot be
read using utf-8!** 4. the bytes generated by encoding a string using
utf-16: ``'⁛④Ⅿ\uf191⚏칵诛ဨ键塴'``

Python 3 doesn't let you ignore a lot of these details. That's good,
because precision in dealing with the EVM is critical.

If you are resistant -- I get it, I've been there. It is not intuitive
for most people. But it's seriously worth it to `learn about
encoding <https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/>`__
if you're going to develop on top of Ethereum. Your ETH depends on it!

Release setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Debian-like systems:

::

    apt install pandoc

To release a new version:

.. code:: sh

    make release bump=$$VERSION_PART_TO_BUMP$$

How to bumpversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The version format for this repo is ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}`` for
stable, and ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{stage}.{devnum}`` for unstable
(``stage`` can be alpha or beta).

To issue the next version in line, specify which part to bump, like
``make release bump=minor`` or ``make release bump=devnum``.

If you are in a beta version, ``make release bump=stage`` will switch to
a stable.

To issue an unstable version when the current version is stable, specify
the new version explicitly, like
``make release bump="--new-version 4.0.0-alpha.1 devnum"``
