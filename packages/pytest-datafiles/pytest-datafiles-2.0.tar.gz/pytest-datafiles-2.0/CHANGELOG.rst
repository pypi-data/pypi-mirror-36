Security

`2.0`_
~~~~~~

Added

* Explicit support for Python 3.6 (no changes were necessary)

Removed

* BREAKING CHANGE: Python 2.6 is no longer supported (because we rely on pytest
  >= 3.6)

Fixed

* Use the new pytest mark API to fix MarkInfo warnings (`#2`_)
* BREAKING CHANGE: Symlinks are now copied as links instead of copying the
  target they point to (`#1`_)

`1.0`_
~~~~~~

Changed

* Bump version to 1.0 to signal that the plugin is stable
* Minor refactorization without repercussions for users
* Only use regular 'paths' (str) instead of py.path objects in documentation
  examples because they were confusing to some people (unfamiliar with py.path)

`0.2`_
~~~~~~

Added

* Support for directories
* Option 'keep_top_dir' to keep the top level directory (instead of only
  copying its content). Possible values are: True, False (default)
* Option 'on_duplicate' to specify what to do when duplicate files or
  directories are encountered. Possible values are: 'exception' (default),
  'ignore', 'overwrite'

`0.1`_
~~~~~~

Added

* Specify one or multiple files to be copied by decorating the test
  function
