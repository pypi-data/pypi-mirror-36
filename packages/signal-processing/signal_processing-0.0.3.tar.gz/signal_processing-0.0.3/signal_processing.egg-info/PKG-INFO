Description: # Introduction
        
        This library is for data that is arranged as follows (in the form of lists - this is just for visual understanding):
        
        |id| Timestamp|values|
        | ------ | ------ | ------- |
        | 1 | 2018:06:05 03:02:00| 2.3|
        | 2 | 2018:06:05 03:04:33| 2.4|
        | 3 | 2018:06:05 03:07:01|3.3
        | 4 | 2018:08:03 03:07:55 | 2.9
        | 5 | 2018:08:03 03:08:44 | 3.3
        | 6 | 2018:08:03 03:12:12  | 2.4
        
        As you can see, the above signal is *a non uniformly sampled signal* as observed by the irregularly spaced timestamps.
        You can apply several functions of this libary to the above data suach as:
        
             import signal_processing as sp
             upsampled_signal = upsampling(input_signal,5) # Does upsampling by a factor of 5
             downsampled_signal = downsampling(upsampled_signal,3) # Does downsampling by a factor of 3
             sampled_signal = sampling_non_uniformly_sampled_signals(input_signal,freq_in_minutes) # samples the signal on a frequency of given minutes
