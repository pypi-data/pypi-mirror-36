Interfaces for an in-memory datastore and calc framework using marshmallow + pandas

==^..^==

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://binx.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

This set of interfaces are designed to help you take your data science project/notebook
and easily turn it into a serializable web-ready API without having to depend on a specific
application or web-framework.

This can help you quickly scale up your scripts and create uniformity between your projects!

binx provides:

* A declarative style in memory datastore (collections)
* An Adapter API that helps model/manage relationships and data transformations between collections (adapter)
* consistent API for moving your data between json, py-objs, and pandas dataframes

Coming Soon
-----------

* A generative orm-style query/filter API for collections based on pandas
* ability to set unique constraints on collection objects
