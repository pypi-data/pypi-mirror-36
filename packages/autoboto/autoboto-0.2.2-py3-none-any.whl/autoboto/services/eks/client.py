        Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.

        The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the
        Kubernetes software, like `etcd` and the API server. The control plane runs in
        an account managed by AWS, and the Kubernetes API is exposed via the Amazon EKS
        API server endpoint.

        Amazon EKS worker nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's
        control plane via the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that
        is created for your cluster.

        The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and
        fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also
        provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide
        connectivity from the control plane instances to the worker nodes (for example,
        to support `kubectl exec`, `logs`, and `proxy` data flows).

        After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes
        tooling to communicate with the API server and launch worker nodes into your
        cluster. For more information, see [Managing Cluster
        Authentication](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-
        auth.html) and [Launching Amazon EKS Worker
        Nodes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html)in
        the _Amazon EKS User Guide_.
