        Gets recommendations for which reservations to purchase. These recommendations
        could help you reduce your costs. Reservations provide a discounted hourly rate
        (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing.

        AWS generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a
        specific time period and collecting your usage into categories that are eligible
        for a reservation. After AWS has these categories, it simulates every
        combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best
        number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings.

        For example, AWS automatically aggregates your EC2 Linux, shared tenancy, and c4
        family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy size-
        flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS recommends
        the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it easier to
        purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of normalized units
        so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For this example, your
        RI recommendation would be for `c4.large`, because that is the smallest size
        instance in the c4 instance family.
