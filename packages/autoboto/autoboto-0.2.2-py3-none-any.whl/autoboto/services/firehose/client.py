        Creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

        By default, you can create up to 50 delivery streams per AWS Region.

        This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial status
        of the delivery stream is `CREATING`. After the delivery stream is created, its
        status is `ACTIVE` and it now accepts data. Attempts to send data to a delivery
        stream that is not in the `ACTIVE` state cause an exception. To check the state
        of a delivery stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream.

        A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records
        directly from providers using PutRecord or PutRecordBatch, or it can be
        configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis
        data stream as input, set the `DeliveryStreamType` parameter to
        `KinesisStreamAsSource`, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name
        (ARN) and role ARN in the `KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration` parameter.

        A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES,
        Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must specify only one of the following
        destination configuration parameters: **ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration** ,
        **S3DestinationConfiguration** , **ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration** ,
        **RedshiftDestinationConfiguration** , or **SplunkDestinationConfiguration**.

        When you specify **S3DestinationConfiguration** , you can also provide the
        following optional values: **BufferingHints** , **EncryptionConfiguration** ,
        and **CompressionFormat**. By default, if no **BufferingHints** value is
        provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes,
        whichever condition is satisfied first. **BufferingHints** is a hint, so there
        are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For
        example, record boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under
        the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed. We
        strongly recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage in
        Amazon S3.

        A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination:

          * An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location. Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses `COPY` syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table. This is specified in the **RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration** parameter.

          * The compression formats `SNAPPY` or `ZIP` cannot be specified in `RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration` because the Amazon Redshift `COPY` operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't support these compression formats.

          * We strongly recommend that you use the user name and password you provide exclusively with Kinesis Data Firehose, and that the permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift `INSERT` permissions.

        Kinesis Data Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the
        destination. The role should allow the Kinesis Data Firehose principal to assume
        the role, and the role should have permissions that allow the service to deliver
        the data. For more information, see [Grant Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an
        Amazon S3
        Destination](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-
        access.html#using-iam-s3) in the _Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide_.

        Each PutRecordBatch request supports up to 500 records. Each record in the

        MB for the entire request. These limits cannot be changed.

        The PutRecordBatch response includes a count of failed records,
        **FailedPutCount** , and an array of responses, **RequestResponses**. Each entry
        in the **RequestResponses** array provides additional information about the
        processed record. It directly correlates with a record in the request array
        using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom. The response array always
        includes the same number of records as the request array. **RequestResponses**
        includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data
        Firehose tries to process all records in each PutRecordBatch request. A single
        record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records.

        A successfully processed record includes a **RecordId** value, which is unique
        for the record. An unsuccessfully processed record includes **ErrorCode** and
        **ErrorMessage** values. **ErrorCode** reflects the type of error, and is one of
        the following values: `ServiceUnavailable` or `InternalFailure`.
        **ErrorMessage** provides more detailed information about the error.

        If there is an internal server error or a timeout, the write might have
        completed or it might have failed. If **FailedPutCount** is greater than 0,
        retry the request, resending only those records that might have failed
        processing. This minimizes the possible duplicate records and also reduces the
        total bytes sent (and corresponding charges). We recommend that you handle any
        duplicates at the destination.

        Updates the specified destination of the specified delivery stream.

        Use this operation to change the destination type (for example, to replace the
        Amazon S3 destination with Amazon Redshift) or change the parameters associated
        with a destination (for example, to change the bucket name of the Amazon S3
        destination). The update might not occur immediately. The target delivery stream
        remains active while the configurations are updated, so data writes to the
        delivery stream can continue during this process. The updated configurations are
        usually effective within a few minutes.

        Switching between Amazon ES and other services is not supported. For an Amazon
        ES destination, you can only update to another Amazon ES destination.

        If the destination type is the same, Kinesis Data Firehose merges the
        configuration parameters specified with the destination configuration that
        already exists on the delivery stream. If any of the parameters are not
        specified in the call, the existing values are retained. For example, in the
        Amazon S3 destination, if EncryptionConfiguration is not specified, then the
        existing `EncryptionConfiguration` is maintained on the destination.

        If the destination type is not the same, for example, changing the destination
        from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift, Kinesis Data Firehose does not merge any
        parameters. In this case, all parameters must be specified.

        Kinesis Data Firehose uses **CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId** to avoid race
        conditions and conflicting merges. This is a required field, and the service
        updates the configuration only if the existing configuration has a version ID
        that matches. After the update is applied successfully, the version ID is
        updated, and can be retrieved using DescribeDeliveryStream. Use the new version
        ID to set **CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId** in the next call.
