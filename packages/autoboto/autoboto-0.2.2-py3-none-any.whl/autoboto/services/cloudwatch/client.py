        Gets statistics for the specified metric.

        The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you
        request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the
        number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple
        requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period.
        Data points are not returned in chronological order.

        CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you
        specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period,
        CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each
        one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is
        larger than the number of data points returned.

        CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you
        publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile
        statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

          * The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.

          * The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.

        Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

          * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a `StorageResolution` of 1.

          * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.

          * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.

          * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).

        Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated
        together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period
        of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution.
        After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable
        only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further
        aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.

        CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.

        A simple way to create a dashboard using `PutDashboard` is to copy an existing

        text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was
        created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could
        also point console users to the location of the `DashboardBody` script or the

        Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric.
        Optionally, this operation can associate one or more Amazon SNS resources with
        the alarm.

        When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to
        `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. The alarm is evaluated and its state is set appropriately.
        Any actions associated with the state are then executed.

        When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update
        completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

        If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some
        operations:

          * `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` for all alarms with EC2 actions

          * `ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus` and `ec2:DescribeInstances` for all alarms on EC2 instance status metrics

          * `ec2:StopInstances` for alarms with stop actions

          * `ec2:TerminateInstances` for alarms with terminate actions

          * `ec2:DescribeInstanceRecoveryAttribute` and `ec2:RecoverInstances` for alarms with recover actions

        If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2,
        you can still create an alarm, but the stop or terminate actions are not
        performed. However, if you are later granted the required permissions, the alarm
        actions that you created earlier are performed.

        If you are using an IAM role (for example, an EC2 instance profile), you cannot
        stop or terminate the instance using alarm actions. However, you can still see
        the alarm state and perform any other actions such as Amazon SNS notifications
        or Auto Scaling policies.

        If you are using temporary security credentials granted using AWS STS, you
        cannot stop or terminate an EC2 instance using alarm actions.

        You must create at least one stop, terminate, or reboot alarm using either the
        Amazon EC2 or CloudWatch consoles to create the **EC2ActionsAccess** IAM role.
        After this IAM role is created, you can create stop, terminate, or reboot alarms
        using a command-line interface or API.

        Publishes metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch associates the

        to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to ListMetrics.

        Each `PutMetricData` request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests.

        Although the `Value` parameter accepts numbers of type `Double`, CloudWatch
        rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the
        range of 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).
        In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not
        supported.

        You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the
        metric collects. For more information about specifying dimensions, see
        [Publishing
        Metrics](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html)

        hours to become available for GetMetricStatistics from the time they are
        submitted.

        CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you
        publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile
        statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

          * The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1
