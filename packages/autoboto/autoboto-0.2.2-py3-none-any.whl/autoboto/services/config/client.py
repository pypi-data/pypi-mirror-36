        account.

        **Example**

          1. AWS Config is recording three resource types in the US East (Ohio) Region for your account: 25 EC2 instances, 20 IAM users, and 15 S3 buckets.

          2. You make a call to the `GetDiscoveredResourceCounts` action and specify that you want all resource types. 

          3. AWS Config returns the following:

            * The resource types (EC2 instances, IAM users, and S3 buckets).

            * The number of each resource type (25, 20, and 15).

            * The total number of all resources (60).

        The response is paginated. By default, AWS Config lists 100 ResourceCount
        objects on each page. You can customize this number with the `limit` parameter.
        The response includes a `nextToken` string. To get the next page of results, run
        the request again and specify the string for the `nextToken` parameter.

        If you make a call to the GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action, you might not
        immediately receive resource counts in the following situations:

          * You are a new AWS Config customer.

          * You just enabled resource recording.

        It might take a few minutes for AWS Config to record and count your resources.
        Wait a few minutes and then retry the GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action.

        You can use this action for custom AWS Config rules and AWS managed Config
        rules. A custom AWS Config rule is a rule that you develop and maintain. An AWS
        managed Config rule is a customizable, predefined rule that AWS Config provides.

        If you are adding a new custom AWS Config rule, you must first create the AWS
        Lambda function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use
        the `PutConfigRule` action to add the rule to AWS Config, you must specify the
        Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that AWS Lambda assigns to the function. Specify the
        ARN for the `SourceIdentifier` key. This key is part of the `Source` object,
        which is part of the `ConfigRule` object.

        If you are adding an AWS managed Config rule, specify the rule's identifier for
        the `SourceIdentifier` key. To reference AWS managed Config rule identifiers,
        see [About AWS Managed Config
        Rules](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-
        config_use-managed-rules.html).

        For any new rule that you add, specify the `ConfigRuleName` in the `ConfigRule`
        object. Do not specify the `ConfigRuleArn` or the `ConfigRuleId`. These values
        are generated by AWS Config for new rules.

        If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule
        by `ConfigRuleName`, `ConfigRuleId`, or `ConfigRuleArn` in the `ConfigRule` data
        type that you use in this request.

        The maximum number of rules that AWS Config supports is 50.
