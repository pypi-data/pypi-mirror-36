        Returns a data encryption key that you can use in your application to encrypt
        data locally.

        You must specify the customer master key (CMK) under which to generate the data
        key. You must also specify the length of the data key using either the `KeySpec`
        or `NumberOfBytes` field. You must specify one field or the other, but not both.
        For common key lengths (128-bit and 256-bit symmetric keys), we recommend that
        you use `KeySpec`. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS
        account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

        This operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key in the `Plaintext` field
        of the response, and an encrypted copy of the data key in the `CiphertextBlob`
        field. The data key is encrypted under the CMK specified in the `KeyId` field of
        the request.

        We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your
        application:

          1. Use this operation (`GenerateDataKey`) to get a data encryption key.

          2. Use the plaintext data encryption key (returned in the `Plaintext` field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.

          3. Store the encrypted data key (returned in the `CiphertextBlob` field of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.

        To decrypt data locally:

          1. Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key into a plaintext copy of the data key.

          2. Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.

        To return only an encrypted copy of the data key, use
        GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext. To return a random byte string that is
        cryptographically secure, use GenerateRandom.

        If you use the optional `EncryptionContext` field, you must store at least
        enough information to be able to reconstruct the full encryption context when
        you later send the ciphertext to the Decrypt operation. It is a good practice to
        choose an encryption context that you can reconstruct on the fly to better
        secure the ciphertext. For more information, see [Encryption
        Context](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encryption-

        This operation is useful in a system that has multiple components with different
        degrees of trust. For example, consider a system that stores encrypted data in
        containers. Each container stores the encrypted data and an encrypted copy of
        the data key. One component of the system, called the _control plane_ , creates
        new containers. When it creates a new container, it uses this operation
        (`GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`) to get an encrypted data key and then stores
        it in the container. Later, a different component of the system, called the
        _data plane_ , puts encrypted data into the containers. To do this, it passes
        the encrypted data key to the Decrypt operation. It then uses the returned
