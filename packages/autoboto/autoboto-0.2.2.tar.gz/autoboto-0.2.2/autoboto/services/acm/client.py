        allow only certificate types and keys they support to be associated with their
        resources. Further, their support differs depending on whether the certificate
        is imported into IAM or into ACM. For more information, see the documentation
        for each service. For more information about importing certificates into ACM,
        see [Importing
        Certificates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-
        certificate.html) in the _AWS Certificate Manager User Guide_.

        ACM does not provide [managed
        renewal](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html) for
        certificates that you import.

        Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:

          * You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.

          * The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.

          * If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its certificate chain.

          * If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain.

          * The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.

          * The current time must be between the `Not Before` and `Not After` certificate fields.

          * The `Issuer` field must not be empty.

          * The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.

          * To import a new certificate, omit the `CertificateArn` argument. Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.

          * When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names preceded by `file://`. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the `C:\temp` folder as `file://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem`. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs. 

          * When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner required by the programming language you're using. 

        This operation returns the [Amazon Resource Name
        (ARN)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-
        namespaces.html) of the imported certificate.
