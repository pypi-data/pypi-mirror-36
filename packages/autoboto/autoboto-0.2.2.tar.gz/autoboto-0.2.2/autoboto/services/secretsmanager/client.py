        Disables automatic scheduled rotation and cancels the rotation of a secret if
        one is currently in progress.

        To re-enable scheduled rotation, call RotateSecret with
        `AutomaticallyRotateAfterDays` set to a value greater than 0. This will
        immediately rotate your secret and then enable the automatic schedule.

        If you cancel a rotation that is in progress, it can leave the `VersionStage`
        labels in an unexpected state. Depending on what step of the rotation was in
        progress, you might need to remove the staging label `AWSPENDING` from the
        partially created version, specified by the `VersionId` response value. You
        should also evaluate the partially rotated new version to see if it should be
        deleted, which you can do by removing all staging labels from the new version's
        `VersionStage` field.

        To successfully start a rotation, the staging label `AWSPENDING` must be in one
        of the following states:

          * Not be attached to any version at all

          * Attached to the same version as the staging label `AWSCURRENT`

        If the staging label `AWSPENDING` is attached to a different version than the

        Creates a new secret. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected
        secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret.

        Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of
        "versions" associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the
        encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more "staging
        labels" that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The
        `SecretVersionsToStages` field of the secret contains the mapping of staging
        labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label
        are considered deprecated and are not included in the list.

        You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the
        `SecretString` parameter or binary data in the `SecretBinary` parameter, but not
        both. If you include `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` then Secrets Manager also
        creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label
        `AWSCURRENT` to the new version.

          * If you call an operation that needs to encrypt or decrypt the `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias `aws/secretsmanager`. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS having to create the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.

          * If the secret is in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the `KMSKeyId`. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.

        contain a new `SecretString` value or a new `SecretBinary` value. You can also
        specify the staging labels that are initially attached to the new version.

        The Secrets Manager console uses only the `SecretString` field. To add binary
        data to a secret with the `SecretBinary` field you must use the AWS CLI or one
        of the AWS SDKs.

          * If this operation creates the first version for the secret then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label `AWSCURRENT` to the new version.

          * If another version of this secret already exists, then this operation does not automatically move any staging labels other than those that you explicitly specify in the `VersionStages` parameter.

          * If this operation moves the staging label `AWSCURRENT` from another version to this version (because you included it in the `StagingLabels` parameter) then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the version that `AWSCURRENT` was removed from.

          * This operation is idempotent. If a version with a `VersionId` with the same value as the `ClientRequestToken` parameter already exists and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you cannot modify an existing version; you can only create new ones.

          * If you call an operation that needs to encrypt or decrypt the `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias `aws/secretsmanager`. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS having to create the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.

          * If the secret is in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the `KMSKeyId`. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt `SecretString` or `SecretBinary` using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.

        configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values
        already stored in the secret. After the rotation completes, the protected
        service and its clients all use the new version of the secret.

        This required configuration information includes the ARN of an AWS Lambda
        function and the time between scheduled rotations. The Lambda rotation function
        creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on

        marks the new secret with the staging label `AWSCURRENT` so that your clients

        secrets.html) in the _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

        Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one is complete.
        Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of
        days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour
        within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat
        randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety
        of factors that help distribute load.

        The rotation function must end with the versions of the secret in one of two
        states:

          * The `AWSPENDING` and `AWSCURRENT` staging labels are attached to the same version of the secret, or

          * The `AWSPENDING` staging label is not attached to any version of the secret.

        If instead the `AWSPENDING` staging label is present but is not attached to the
        same version as `AWSCURRENT` then any later invocation of `RotateSecret` assumes
        that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error.
