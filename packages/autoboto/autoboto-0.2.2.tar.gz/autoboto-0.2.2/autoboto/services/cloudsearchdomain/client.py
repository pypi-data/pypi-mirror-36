        Retrieves a list of documents that match the specified search criteria. How you
        specify the search criteria depends on which query parser you use. Amazon
        CloudSearch supports four query parsers:

          * `simple`: search all `text` and `text-array` fields for the specified string. Search for phrases, individual terms, and prefixes. 
          * `structured`: search specific fields, construct compound queries using Boolean operators, and use advanced features such as term boosting and proximity searching.
          * `lucene`: specify search criteria using the Apache Lucene query parser syntax.
          * `dismax`: specify search criteria using the simplified subset of the Apache Lucene query parser syntax defined by the DisMax query parser.

        a collection of add and delete operations that represent the documents you want

        JSON or XML. Each item that you want Amazon CloudSearch to return as a search
