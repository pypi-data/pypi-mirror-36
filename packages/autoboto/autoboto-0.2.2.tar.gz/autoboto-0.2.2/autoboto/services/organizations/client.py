        Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual
        account. How the policy affects accounts depends on the type of policy:

          * **Service control policy (SCP)** \- An SCP specifies what permissions can be delegated to users in affected member accounts. The scope of influence for a policy depends on what you attach the policy to:

            * If you attach an SCP to a root, it affects all accounts in the organization.

            * If you attach an SCP to an OU, it affects all accounts in that OU and in any child OUs.

            * If you attach the policy directly to an account, then it affects only that account.

        SCPs essentially are permission "filters". When you attach one SCP to a higher
        level root or OU, and you also attach a different SCP to a child OU or to an
        account, the child policy can further restrict only the permissions that pass
        through the parent filter and are available to the child. An SCP that is
        attached to a child cannot grant a permission that is not already granted by the
        parent. For example, imagine that the parent SCP allows permissions A, B, C, D,
        and E. The child SCP allows C, D, E, F, and G. The result is that the accounts
        affected by the child SCP are allowed to use only C, D, and E. They cannot use A
        or B because they were filtered out by the child OU. They also cannot use F and
        G because they were filtered out by the parent OU. They cannot be granted back
        by the child SCP; child SCPs can only filter the permissions they receive from
        the parent SCP.

        AWS Organizations attaches a default SCP named `"FullAWSAccess` to every root,
        OU, and account. This default SCP allows all services and actions, enabling any
        new child OU or account to inherit the permissions of the parent root or OU. If
        you detach the default policy, you must replace it with a policy that specifies
        the permissions that you want to allow in that OU or account.

If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at [ To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

          * If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization or that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists after an hour, then contact [AWS Customer Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).

          * Because `CreateAccount` operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account.
