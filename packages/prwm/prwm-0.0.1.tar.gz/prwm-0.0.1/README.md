Packed Raw WebGL Model (PRWM) and PRWB (Packed Raw WebGL Binary) encoder

Packed Raw WebGL Model is a binary file format for nD geometries specifically designed for JavaScript and WebGL with a strong focus on fast parsing (from 1ms to 0.1ms 
in Chrome 59 on a MBP Late 2013).

See https://github.com/kchapelier/PRWM for specifications detail
