Description: # Neet: Simulating and analyzing network models
        
        **Neet** is a python package designed to provide an easy-to-use API for creating
        and evaluating network models. In its current state, **Neet** supports
        simulating synchronous Boolean network models, though the API is designed to be
        model generic. Future work will implement asynchronous update mechanisms and
        more general network types.
        
        If you are interested in using **Neet**, you'll definitely be interested in
        checking out the documentation - https://elife-asu.github.io/Neet.
        
        [![Build Status (Travis CI)](https://travis-ci.org/ELIFE-ASU/Neet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ELIFE-ASU/Neet)
        [![Build Status (Appveyor)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/eyrn6l2wygeglnx5/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dglmoore/neet-awnxe/branch/master)
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Via Pip
        
        To install via `pip`, you can run the following
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install neet
        ```
        
        Note that on some systems this will require administrative privileges. If you
        don't have admin privileges or would prefer to install **Neet** for your user
        only, you do so via the `--user` flag:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install --user neet
        ```
        
        ### From Source
        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/elife-asu/neet
        $ cd neet
        $ python setup.py test
        $ pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Getting Help
        **Neet** is developed to help people interested in using and analyzing network
        models to get things done quickly and painlessly. Your feedback is
        indispensable. Please create an issue if you find a bug, an error in the
        documentation, or have a feature you'd like to request. Your contribution will
        make **Neet** a better tool for everyone.
        
        If you are interested in contributing to **Neet**, please contact the
        developers. We'll get you up and running!
