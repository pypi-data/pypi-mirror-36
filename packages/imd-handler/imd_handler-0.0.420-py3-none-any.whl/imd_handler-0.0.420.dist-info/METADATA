# IMDiddler
A tool for editing IMD files either from local or s3
Can be deployed/invoked as a lambda or command line.
IMD file order is preserved. IMD edits can be in arbitrary order

### Editing Specifier
The edit to the imd is specified by a json string which maps the key/value pairs and simply replaces 
an existing key/value pair in the IMD file with the key/value pair in the json string. There's no limit on how
long you make the edit specifiers you can edit one or all the items in an IMD with a single specifier.
It is a simple overlaying operation. The one special consideration is for the 'BEGIN_GROUP/END_GROUP' pair, discussed below.
One can specify any of the types in the IMD. The following edits are for each of the individual types 
#####String
 ```javascript
'{"version": "\\"28.4\\";"}'
```
#####Integer
 ```javascript
'{"numRows": 6932;"}'
```
#####Date
 ```javascript
'{"generationTime": 2017-08-01T03:39:53.000000Z;"}'
```
You get the idea...

####Groups
IMDs contain a BEGIN_GROUP=<name> and END_GROUP=<name> for bands, images and products. The naming scheme is the disambiguator.
You can edit the contents of a group by specifying the name of the group within the IMD as a key and then a sub-dictionary
of key/value pairs to be applied within the group. The following edits the "IMAGE_1" group in the IMD, replacing the satellite name.
```javascript
'"IMAGE_1": {"satId": "\\"WV09\\";"}}'
```

### Invocation
The code can be invoked either via the command line or as a lambda. 

#### Command line
```commandline
python imd_handler.py <input file/s3 object> <edit[s]>
```
The input file is a file URI, self explanatory (any valid path, read/write access required)
```commandline
file:///Volumes/GKW/Sibinacocha2017/1cc99383-29fd-470a-a3ac-22431193b65a/103001006A803400/056848496010_01/056848496010_01_P001_MUL/17MAY12150511-M1BS-056848496010_01_P001.IMD
```

The s3 Object is an S3 URI specifying the bucket and path for the name ie:
```commandline
s3://727281582563-deliveries/production/I00000070198_01/I00000070198_01_P001_MUL/18APR05102137-M1BS_R1C1-I00000070198_01_P001.IMD
```

#### As a lambda
It's deployed as IMDiddler. The event dictionary/payload should look like:

```json
{
    "file_uri":  "<input file/s3 object>"
    "edit" : 
    {
        "<edit tag>" : "<edit value>"
    }
}
```

#####Lambda Example payload
```json
{
    "file_uri" :  "s3://727281582563-deliveries/production/I00000070198_01/I00000070198_01_P001_MUL/18APR05102137-M1BS_R1C1-I00000070198_01_P001.IMD"
    "edit" : 
    {
        "version": "\"28.4\";",
        "IMAGE_1": {"satId": "\"WV09;\""}
    }
}
```

#####Nota Bene:
 IMD Files contain quoted strings which means that the edits performed must also contain the quotes. 
 This means that the JSON quote escapement mechanism must be used for string types. Other types (float, int, date) do not
 need this.
