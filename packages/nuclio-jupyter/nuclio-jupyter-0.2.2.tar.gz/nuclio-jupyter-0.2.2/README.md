Convert Jupyter notebook to Python code that can run as [nuclio](https://nuclio.io/) handler

## Installing

    pip install nuclio-jupyter

### Install in Notebook

Run the following in a cell

```
# nuclio: ignore
!pip install nuclio-jupyter
```

## Usage

When developing, import `Context` and `Event` from `nucilo` and use it to
generate a mock context and request.

```python
# nuclio: ignore
from nuclio import Context, Event

context = Context()
event = Event(body='Hello Nuclio')
# your code goes here
```

In the cell you'd like to become the handler, added the comment `#
nuclio:handler`. If there's a specific line you'd like to be the returned one -
added `# nuclio:return` at the end of it.

Cells containing `# nuclio: ignore` comment will be commented out in the export
process.

Now choose `File/Download as/Nuclio` in Jupyter notebook (you might need to
mark the notebook as `Trusted` in order for the Nuclio option to show)

![](docs/menu.png)

Or you can run

```
jupyter nbconvert --to nuclio example.ipynb
```


This will create `example.py` with your code wrapped in handler function and all
cells with `# nuclio: ignore` commented out.

### Example

![](docs/example.png)

Will generate

```python
# Generated by nuclio-jupyter exporter

# In[1]:
def greeting(name):
    return 'Hi ' + name + '. How are you?'

# In[2]:
default_name = 'Dave'

# In[3]:

# In[4]:
def handler(context, event):
    # nuclio:handler
    return greeting(event.body)
```

### Other Notebooks

We currently don't support [Jupyter Lab][lab], [Google Colaboratory][colab],
[Kaggle Notebooks][kaggle] and others.

You can use `nuclio.print_handler_code` or `nuclio.save_handler_code` to
print/save the handler code and then copy&paste it to [the nuclio
dashboard][dashboard].

## Try It Out

You can build a docker image and try it out

### Build

    $ docker build -t jupyter-nuclio .

### Run

    $ docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter-nuclio

Then open your browser at http://localhost:8888


## Developing

We're using [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) as package manager. To install
dependencies run

    $ pipenv sync -d

To run the tests run
