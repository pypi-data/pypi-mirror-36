        You have found Selene, a Python library and command line interface for training deep neural networks from biological sequence data such as genomes.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Selene is a Python 3+ package. We recommend using it with Python 3.6 or above. 
        
        ### Installing selene with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (for Linux):
        
        ```sh
        conda install -c bioconda selene-sdk
        ```
        
        ### Installing selene with pip:
        ```sh
        pip install selene-sdk
        ```
        
        ### Installing selene from source:
        
        First, download the latest commits from the source repository:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/FunctionLab/selene.git
        ```
        
        The `setup.py` script requires NumPy. Please make sure you have this already installed.
        
        If you plan on working in the `selene` repository directly, we recommend [setting up a conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) using `selene-cpu.yml` or `selene-gpu.yml` (if CUDA is enabled on your machine) and activating it.
        
        Selene contains some Cython files. You can build these by running
        ```sh
        python setup.py build_ext --inplace
        ```
        
        Otherwise, if you would like to locally install Selene, you can run
        ```sh
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Please install `docopt` before running the command-line script `selene_cli.py` provided in the repository.
