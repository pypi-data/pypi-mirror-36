        Description
        --------
        
        `resample` provides a set of tools for performing randomization-based inference in Python, primarily through the use of bootstrapping methods and Monte Carlo permutation tests.  See the [example notebook](https://github.com/dsaxton/resample/blob/master/examples/resample.ipynb) for a brief tutorial.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Bootstrap samples (ordinary or balanced, both with optional stratification and smoothing) of arrays with arbitrary dimension
        * Parametric bootstrap samples (Gaussian, Poisson, gamma, etc.) of one-dimensional arrays
        * Bootstrap confidence intervals (percentile, BCA and Studentized) for any well-defined parameter
        * Jackknife estimates of bias and variance
        * Randomization-based variants of traditional statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA F-test, K-S test, etc.)
        * Tools for working with empirical distributions (empirical cumulative distribution and quantile functions, empirical influence functions, distance metrics for comparing distributions)
