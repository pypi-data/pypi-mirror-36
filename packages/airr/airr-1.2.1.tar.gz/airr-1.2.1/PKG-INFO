        **Installation**
        
        Install in the usual manner from PyPI::
        
            > pip3 install airr --user
        
        Or from the `downloaded <https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards>`__
        source code directory::
        
            > python3 setup.py install --user
        
        **Reading AIRR formatted files**
        
        The ``airr`` package contains functions to read and write AIRR data files
        as either iterables or pandas data frames. The usage is straightforward,
        as the file format is a typical tab delimited file, but the package
        performs some additional validation and type conversion beyond using a
        standard CSV reader.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import airr
        
            # Create an iteratable that returns a dictionary for each row
            reader = airr.read_rearrangement('input.tsv')
        
            # Load the entire file into a pandas data frame
            df = airr.load_rearrangement('input.tsv')
        
        **Writing AIRR formatted files**
        
        Similar to the read operations, write functions are provided for either creating
        a writer class to perform row-wise output or writing the entire contents of
        a pandas data frame to a file. Again, usage is straightforward with the `airr`
        output functions simply performing some type conversion and field ordering
        operations.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import airr
        
            # Create a writer class for iterative row output
            writer = airr.create_rearrangement('output.tsv')
            for row in reader:  writer.write(row)
        
            # Write an entire pandas data frame to a file
            airr.dump_rearrangement(df, 'file.tsv')
