Description: # Pyfrpc
        
        Pyfrpc is a Python implementation of FastRPC protocol/library (
        [@github](https://seznam.github.io/frpc/) or
        [@sourceforge](http://fastrpc.sourceforge.net/)
        ). The original library contains Python bindings, but:
        
        1. I prefer python packages without dependencies on debian packages.
        2. Its flexibility is limited in some points. E.g. the library provides its own 
        implementation of HTTP server and client, which is nice to have in C++, but not 
        in Python I would say as there are already full-featured and more mature 
        libraries available for those tasks.
        3. In my opinion it's not worth to wrap such a library for python anyway (at 
        least not from today's perspective). The original binding itself is 3500 lines 
        of code. So this is an alternative aproach.
        4. And I want to use it as a showcase for cython as well.
        
        This library provides FastRPC encoding/decoding functions, FastRPC client 
        (based on 'requests') and an interactive FastRPC client/terminal 'pyfrpc' (an 
        alternative to 'fastrpc-netcat' based on 'IPython'). API mostly differs and is 
        not meant to be a drop-in replacement.
        
        It is compatible with protocol versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0.
        
        Package provides both cython (C extencion) and pure python implementations. 
        Cython implementation is faster but requires C toolchain (or available python 
        wheels). To use pure python implementation set env variable `PYFRPC_NOEXT=1` 
        during installation.
        
        Some features missing are:
        
        - handling of base64 encoded FastRPC
        - helper to build a server
        
        Aside from distribution as a python package, it's also possible to download 
        single-file amalgamated distribution: 
        [pyfrpc.py](https://gitlab.com/vladaburian/pyfrpc/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/
        dist/pyfrpc.py?job=archive).
        
        
        ## Interactive client
        
        Interactive client opens na ipython session with varible `client` initialized to 
        FastFRPC connection. It supports tab-based completion of remote procedures' 
        names as well as shownig their documentation using question mark notation as is 
        usual in ipython.
        
        ```
        $ pyfrpc --help
        
        usage: pyfrpc [-h] [--insecure] URL
        
        FRPC netcat for interactive connection to FRPC server
        
        positional arguments:
          URL         URL of FRPC server to connect to
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          --insecure  Do not check server's cert
        ```
        
        ```
        $ pyfrpc http://my-avesome-server
        
        In [1]: client.greeting?
        ...
        Docstring:   Prints greeting.
        
        In [2]: client.greeting()
        Out[2]: 
        'hello from server'
        ```
