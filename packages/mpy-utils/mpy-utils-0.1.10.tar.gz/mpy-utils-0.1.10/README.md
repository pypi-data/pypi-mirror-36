## Submitting Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request, please add yourself to the list of contributors below,
and install [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) so you can reformat your code using
the following command:

```
black *.py bin/* mpy_utils/*.py
```

This will hopefully prevent me from ever having to think about source code formatting again.
