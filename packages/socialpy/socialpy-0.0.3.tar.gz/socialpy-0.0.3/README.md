# SocialPy
Use social networks like a hacker.

SocialPy has multiple function and is designed to be very flexible. The command
line tools allowed you to post viva the terminal. This is the way hacker should
post. Write your own scrips to post automatically. To storage some post, i
implement a data-serve with a web front end. It's only a django project and has
vary low security settings. Don't push it to a public web-server.

SocialPy is a small private project. I do it just for fun. So some parts are
really dirty. I would clean them up, if I'm boring. Or watch Rick and Morty? :D

## quick start
It's a python package, use pip to install.
```bash
pip install socialpy
```
Now setup the gateway. All keys are storage in your home folder ~/.socialpy
```bash
python -m socialpy.client setup
```
Where you find the key's? That is a little bit difficult. Maybe I should write
something about that. Or should I watch Rick and Morty again?

It's time to post something funny.
```bash
???
```
You can write your own python script and do crazy stuff.
```python
???
```
Look in the examples folder for more fun.

Before you can use the data-server, you have to initialize the database.
```bash
python -m socialpy.server setup
```
Start the server
```bash
python -m socialpy.server run
```
and then go to http://your.ip:9999. Write some awesome text. Enter the data from your scrips
```python
from socialpy.data import Post

for post in Post.objects.all():
  #do something with the post
```

This was the quick start. You can you much more. The doc coming soon, I promise.

## Setup Raspberry Pi
I use a Raspberry Pi as a small server. This is how I set it up.
