Description: AVRO-GEN-TOPKRABBENSTEAM
        =========================
        ##### Avro record class and specific record reader generator.
        
        Based on the original github project https://github.com/rbystrit/avro_gen, this one was forked in order to fix a problem related to load this library in a docker container. Problem was solved by rewriting tiny bit of a code, which generates "schema.avsc" file.
        Loading this file in a docker container was a problem, so we decided to store "schema.avsc" file internally inside schema_classes.py file as a string.
        The same approach is used by avrogen library developed for .Net Core AvroGen.
         
        ##### Usage:
        		import json
        		import io
        		with open("schema.json",'r') as file:            
        			schema_json = file.read()
        			output_directory = "SchemaDir"
        			from avrogen import write_schema_files
        			write_schema_files(schema_json, output_directory)
