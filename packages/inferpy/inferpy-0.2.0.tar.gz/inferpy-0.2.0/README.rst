InferPy: Deep Probabilistic Modeling Made Easy
===============================================


InferPy is a high-level API for probabilistic modeling written in Python and 
capable of running on top of Edward and Tensorflow. InferPy's API is 
strongly inspired by Keras and it has a focus on enabling flexible data processing, 
easy-to-code probablistic modeling, scalable inference and robust model validation.

Use InferPy is you need a probabilistic programming language that:

* Allows easy and fast prototyping of hierarchical probabilistic models with a simple and user friendly API inspired by Keras. 
* Defines probabilistic models with complex probabilistic constructs containing deep neural networks.   
* Automatically creates computational efficient batched models without the need to deal with complex tensor operations.
* Run seamlessly on CPU and GPU by relying on Tensorflow. 

.. * Process seamlessly small data sets stored on a Panda's data-frame, or large distributed data sets by relying on Apache Spark.

InferPy is to Edward what Keras is to Tensorflow
-------------------------------------------------
InferPy's aim is to be to Edward what Keras is to Tensorflow. Edward is a general purpose
probabilistic programing language, like Tensorflow is a general computational engine. 
But this generality comes a at price. Edward's API is
verbose and is based on distributions over Tensor objects, which are n-dimensional arrays with 
complex semantics operations. Probability distributions over Tensors are powerful abstractions 
but it is not easy to operate with them. InferPy's API is no so general like Edward's API 
but still covers a wide range of powerful and widely used probabilistic models, which can contain
complex probability constructs containing deep neural networks.  

Getting Started: 30 seconds to InferPy
======================================

The core data structures of InferPy is a **probabilistic model**,
defined as a set of **random variables** with a conditional independence
structure. Like in Edward, a **random varible** is an object
parameterized by a set of tensors.

Let's look at a simple (Bayesian) **probabilistic component analysis** model. Graphically the model can 
be defined as follows,

   Bayesian PCA

We start defining the **prior** of the global parameters, 

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import inferpy as inf
    from inferpy.models import Normal, InverseGamma, Dirichlet
	
    # K defines the number of components. 
    K=10
    
    #Prior for the principal components
    with inf.replicate(size = K)
    	mu = Normal(loc = 0, scale = 1, dim = d)

InferPy supports the definition of **plateau notation** by using the
construct ``with inf.replicate(size = K)``, which replicates K times the
random variables enclosed within this anotator. Every replicated
variable is assumed to be **independent**.

This ``with inf.replicate(size = N)`` construct is also useful when
defining the model for the data:

.. code:: python

    # Number of observations
    N = 1000
    
    #data Model
    with inf.replicate(size = N):
    	# Latent representation of the sample
    	w_n = Normal(loc = 0, scale = 1, dim = K)
    	# Observed sample. The dimensionality of mu is [K,d]. 
    	x = Normal(loc = mu0 + inf.matmul(w_n,mu), scale = 1.0, observed = true)

As commented above, the variable ``w_n`` and ``x_n`` are surrounded by a
``with`` statement to inidicate that the defined random variables will
be reapeatedly used in each data sample. In this case, every replicated
variable is conditionally idependent given the variables mu and sigma
defined outside the ``with`` statement.

Once the random variables of the model are defined, the probablitic
model itself can be created and compiled. The probabilistic model
defines a joint probability distribuiton over all these random
variables.

.. code:: python

    from inferpy import ProbModel
    
    # Define the model
    pca = ProbModel(vars = [mu,w_n,x_n]) 
    
    # Compile the model
    pca.compile(infMethod = 'KLqp')

During the model compilation we specify different inference methods that
will be used to learn the model.

.. code:: python

    from inferpy import ProbModel
    
    # Define the model
    pca = ProbModel(vars = [mu,w_n,x_n]) 
    
    # Compile the model
    pca.compile(infMethod = 'MCMC')

The inference method can be further configure. But, as in Keras, a core
principle is to try make things reasonbly simple, while allowing the
user the full control if needed.

.. code:: python

    from keras.optimizers import SGD
   
    # Define the model
    pca = ProbModel(vars = [mu,w_n,x_n]) 

    # Define the optimiser
    sgd = SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)

    # Define the inference method
    infklqp = inf.inference.KLqp(optimizer = sgd, loss="ELBO")

    # Compile the model
    pca.compile(infMethod = infklqp)

Every random variable object is equipped with methods such as
``log_prob()`` and ``sample()``. Similarly, a probabilistic model is also
equipped with the same methods. Then, we can sample data from the model
anbd compute the log-likelihood of a data set:

.. code:: python

    # Sample data from the model
    data = pca.sample(size = 100)

    # Compute the log-likelihood of a data set
    log_like = probmodel.log_prob(data)

Of course, you can fit your model with a given data set:

.. code:: python

    # Fit the model with the given data
    pca.fit(data_training, epochs=10)

Update your probablistic model with new data using the Bayes' rule:

.. code:: python

    # Update the model with the new data
    pca.update(new_data)

Query the posterior over a given random varible:

.. code:: python

    # Compute the posterior of a given random variable
    mu_post = pca.posterior(mu)

Evaluate your model according to a given metric:

.. code:: python

    # Evaluate the model on given test data set using some metric
    log_like = pca.evaluate(test_data, metrics = ['log_likelihood'])

Or compute predicitons on new data

.. code:: python

    # Make predictions over a target var
    latent_representation = pca.predict(test_data, targetvar = w_n)
