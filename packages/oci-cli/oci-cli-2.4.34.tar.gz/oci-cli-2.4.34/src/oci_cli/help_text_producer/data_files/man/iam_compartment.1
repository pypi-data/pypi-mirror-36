.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A collection of related resources. Compartments are a fundamental component of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for organizing and isolating your cloud resources. You use them to clearly separate resources for the purposes of measuring usage and billing, access (through the use of IAM Service policies), and isolation (separating the resources for one project or business unit from another). A common approach is to create a compartment for each major part of your organization. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP> and also \fI\%Setting Up Your Tenancy\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/settinguptenancy.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To place a resource in a compartment, simply specify the compartment ID in the "Create" request object when initially creating the resource. For example, to launch an instance into a particular compartment, specify that compartment\(aqs OCID in the \fILaunchInstance\fP request. You can\(aqt move an existing resource from one compartment to another.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.SS create
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new compartment in your tenancy.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP Compartments cannot be deleted.
.sp
You must specify your tenancy\(aqs OCID as the compartment ID in the request object. Remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIname\fP for the compartment, which must be unique across all compartments in your tenancy. You can use this name or the OCID when writing policies that apply to the compartment. For more information about policies, see \fI\%How Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the compartment (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdateCompartment\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Compartment/UpdateCompartment\fP>\&.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.

.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the tenancy containing the compartment. [required]
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name you assign to the compartment during creation. The name must be unique across all compartments in the tenancy. Avoid entering confidential information. [required]
.SS \-\-description [text]
.sp
The description you assign to the compartment during creation. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. [required]
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.

The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [CREATING|ACTIVE|INACTIVE|DELETING|DELETED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used
.SS \-?, \-h, \-\-help
.sp
Show this message and exit.
.SS get
.SS Description
.sp
Gets the specified compartment\(aqs information.
.sp
This operation does not return a list of all the resources inside the compartment. There is no single API operation that does that. Compartments can contain multiple types of resources (instances, block storage volumes, etc.). To find out what\(aqs in a compartment, you must call the "List" operation for each resource type and specify the compartment\(aqs OCID as a query parameter in the request. For example, call the \fI\%ListInstances\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Instance/ListInstances\fP> operation in the Cloud Compute Service or the \fI\%ListVolumes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Volume/ListVolumes\fP> operation in Cloud Block Storage.
