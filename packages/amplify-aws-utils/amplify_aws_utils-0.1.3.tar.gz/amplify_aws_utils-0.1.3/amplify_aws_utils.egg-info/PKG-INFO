        Utility functions for working with AWS resources
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        amplify\_aws\_utils requires the following to be installed:
        
        ::
        
            python >= 2.7
        
        For development, ``tox>=2.9.1`` is recommended.
        
        Building
        --------
        
        Python package can be built as follows:
        
        ``python setup.py sdist``
        
        This creates a package in ``dist`` directory.
        
        Running Tests
        -------------
        
        As mentioned above, amplify\_aws\_utils uses tox, so running ``tox``
        will automatically execute linters as well as the unit tests. You can
        also run functional and integration tests by using the -e argument.
        
        For example, ``tox -e lint,py27-unit,py27-integration`` will run the
        linters, and then the unit and integration tests in python 2.7.
        
        To see all the available options, run ``tox -l``.
        
        Deployment
        ----------
        
        Deployment is done with Jenkins Pipeline (Jenkinsfile)
        
        Package is built as described above, and is uploaded to PyPI repo using
        ``devpi-client``
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package can be installed using ``pip``
        
        ``pip install amplify_aws_utils``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Functions provided by this package can be imported after package has
        been installed.
        
        Example:
        
        ``from amplify_aws_utils.resource_helper import throttled_call``
