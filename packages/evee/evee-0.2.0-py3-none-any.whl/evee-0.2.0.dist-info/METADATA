Summary
_______

This is a port for Python `v3.6+` of the Symfony Event Dispatcher.

This event dispatcher follows a pattern called the ["Mediator" pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/mediator).

> In software engineering, the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.

Install
--------
`pip install evee`

Usage
--------

### Dispatching simple events

```python
from evee import EventDispatcher
from evee import Event

def pre_foo(self, event: Event, event_name: str):
    print("pre_foo was called")

def post_foo(self, event: Event, event_name: str):
    print("post_foo was called")

dispatcher = EventDispatcher()
dispatcher.add_listener('pre.foo', pre_foo)
dispatcher.add_listener('post.foo', post_foo)
dispatcher.dispatch('pre.foo')
print('Doo Foo work')
dispatcher.dispatch('post.foo')
```
