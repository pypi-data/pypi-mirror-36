Description: ï»¿# diapy
        >Version 3.1.1
        
        A minimal diary manager based on python.
        
        Diapy uses `cryptography.fernet` to encrypt your top secret.
        
        ## Installation
        Simple, crude.
        
            pip install diapy
        	
        ## Usage
        Firstly, you need to create a new diary file. Or you can open an exist file. There isn't much difference.
        
            >>> from diapy import Diary
            >>> d = Diary('new.diary')
            Please input the main password: # Enter your password here! No one will see it.
            >>>
        You can keep your today's diary without inputing dates.
        
            >>> d.new('Today is a good day!')
            2018-08-12 18:37:02 Sunday
            Today is a good day!
            >>>
        If you have written a diary on the same day, you will be asked to choose.
        
            >>> d.new('I forget writing diary or not.')
            You have written a diary today:
            2018-08-12 18:37:02 Sunday
            Today is a good day!
        
            Do you want to overwrite, discard changes or merge them together?
            (overwrite/discard/merge) Default: discard
            merge # If you input merge, diapy will keep your diary after the previous one. The time will use the current one.
            2018-08-12 19:18:07 Sunday
            Today is a good day!
            I forget writing diary or not.
        If you forget to write a diary yesterday, you can give a datetime object to the function.
        
            >>> from datetime import datetime
            >>> yesterday = datetime(2018, 8, 11, 19, 34)
            >>> d.new('OOPS, I forgot to write my diary yesterday!', yesterday)
            2018-08-11 19:34:00 Saturday
            OOPS, I forgot to write my diary yesterday!
            >>>
        You can access your diary by a 8 digit key.
        
            >>> d[20180812]
            2018-08-12 18:37:02 Sunday
            Today is a good day!
            >>>
        Actually, it returns an `Entry` object.
        
            >>> e = d[20180812]
            >>> e.timestamp
            1534072687
            >>> e.content
            'Today is a good day!\nI forget writing diary or not.'
            >>>
        If you wonders how many diaries you have written, you can use the `key` function.
        
            >>> d.key()
            [20180812, 20180811]
            >>>
        You can change your password.
        (Not working if you forget your password. 2333)
        
            >>> d.change_pwd()
            Please input the new password: 
            >>>
        To get a random diary entry.
        
            >>> d.random()
            2018-08-12 19:18:07 Sunday
            Today is a good day!
            I forget writing diary or not.
            >>>
        Search text in your diaries.
        
            >>> d.search('day')
            2018-08-12 19:18:07 Sunday
            Today is a good day!
            I forget writing diary or not.
        
            2018-08-11 19:34:00 Saturday
            OOPS, I forgot to write my diary yesterday!
        
            >>>
        Exporting and importing diaries. It is often used when you wanted to do something directly to your diary. It is **not recommended** in most cases.
        
        **Notice! It will expose your secrets! Import operation will overwrite your current diary!**
        
            >>> d._content
            {1534072687: 'Today is a good day!\nI forget writing diary or not.', 1533987240: 'OOPS, I forgot to write my diary yesterday!'}
            >>> d._content = {1534072687: 'Today is a bad day!\nI forget writing diary or not.', \
            ...     1533987240: 'OOPS, I forgot to write my diary yesterday!'}
            >>>
        When all done, save changes by the close function.
        
        **Don't exit without the close function! Or your changes will not be saved.**
        
            >>> d.close()
            >>>
