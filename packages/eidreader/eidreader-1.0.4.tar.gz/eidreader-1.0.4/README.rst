=========================
The ``eidreader`` package
=========================




eidreader is a command-line script which reads data from Belgian eID
cards and writes the data to stdout or posts it to a web server.

Not to be mixed up with its deprecated Java predecessor `eidreader
<https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader>`__ (same project name but
another account).
