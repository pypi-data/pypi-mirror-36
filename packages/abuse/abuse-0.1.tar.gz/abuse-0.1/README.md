# Abuse: World's First Profanity Library™


**Behold, the power of Abuse v1:**


- Let's import the beast first :

```
>>>import abuse as ab
>>>ab.ListAbusesFrom("a")

['...', '...', '...'] #gives a list of abuses starting with the letter 'a'
```



**Abuse** allows you to use profanity when you need it, without the need for getting angry. There's no need to manually search curse words from **Google**, or to ask anybody. Abuse is 100% automatic, thanks to Python.

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. You should try it!
