Exceptions.

These exceptions are raised when processing responses from the server. For example, if
the response was garbage and could not be parsed, `ParseResponseError` is raised.

To handle them, use a try-block when calling send/request/notify:

    try:
        client.notify('go')
    except JsonRpcClientError as e:
        ...
