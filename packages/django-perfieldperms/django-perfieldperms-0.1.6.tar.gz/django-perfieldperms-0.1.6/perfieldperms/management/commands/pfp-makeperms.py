    """
    Used to pre-generate permissions for models. Sources models from the
    PFPContentType table, or from the setting PFP_MODELS. If both
    sources are configured merges the lists.
    
    For each model listed gets a list of model level permissions, and for each
    model level perm generates a set of per-field permissions corresponding to
    each field on the model. These permissions take the form:
    <model-level-codename>__<field-name>

    If fields have been changed permissions are added/removed as appropriate.

    If you want to exclude a model level permissions add it to the setting
    PFP_IGNOREPERMS.

    Settings:
    PFP_MODELS -- an iterable of two tuples (app_label, model name) of models
            you want pfps created for.
    PFP_IGNORE_PERMS -- a dict of dicts of iterables of permissions you want
            ignored when creating pfps. Structured:
            {app_label:
                {model name: [<perm codename>, <perm codename>,..]}
            }
    PFP_IGNORE_DELETE -- By default perfieldperms doesn't create field level
            delete permissions as this doesn't necessarily make sense. Set to
            False if you want to create delete pfps.
    PFP_IGNORE_VIEW -- By default perfieldperms doesn't create field level
            view permissions as this doesn't necessarily make sense. Set to
            False if you want to create view pfps.
