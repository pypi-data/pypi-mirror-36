Filterring of single scattering albedo from [Doose et al (2016)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2015.09.039) complemented with CIRS measurement

Tholins CVD
------------
Laboratory produced optical index constant for tholins aerosols based on [Tomasko et al, 2008](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2007.11.019).
