The following EBS volumes are not attached to an instance. Please consider deleting them to reduce cost and risks related to retaining old data.

If you are confident these volumes are required, using the AWS Console add a new tag to the volume with the Name `cinq:ignore` (the value does not matter)

{% for issue in issues %}
*Account:* `{{ issue.volume.account.account_name }}`
*Region:* `{{ issue.volume.location }}`
*Volume ID:* `{{ issue.volume.id }}`
*Notes:* {{ issue.notes | slack_quote_join }}
*Size:* `{{ issue.volume.size }}GB`

{% endfor %}
