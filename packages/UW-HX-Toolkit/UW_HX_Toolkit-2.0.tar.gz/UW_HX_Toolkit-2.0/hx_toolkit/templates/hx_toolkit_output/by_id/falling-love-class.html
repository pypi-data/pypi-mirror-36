        <p>No matter your major (yes, there are some courses you have to take), choosing your classes continues to be a way to explore new ideas, challenge yourself, and be immersed in different worlds. You can make those NWs and VLPAs work for you!</p>


<h3>Finding a Match</h3>
<p>Here are some ideas for using those opportunities wisely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check out the current courses being taught by faculty who have won <a href=" http://www.washington.edu/teaching/awards/awards-recipients">Distinguished Teaching Awards</a>.</li>
<li>Think back on your favorite class or subject â€“ what courses will give you the opportunity to dive deeper?</li>
<li>Is your favorite professor teaching something new? Email them and ask!</li>
<li>Advisers have <a href="https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/academic-planning/choosing-courses/courses-recommended-by-advisers">suggestions for great courses</a> in their departments; searching websites and blogs can often unearth some gems.</li>
<li>Ask your friends about their favorite classes.</li>
