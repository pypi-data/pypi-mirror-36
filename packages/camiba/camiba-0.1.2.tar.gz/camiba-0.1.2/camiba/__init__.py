r"""Camiba â€“ Algorithms Coming to Life

We aim at providing a collection of non tested but heavily used algorithms,
which revolve around compressed sensing and sparse recovery in the widest
sense.

Camiba provides methods for:
 * sparse recovery
 * sensing matrix design
 * performance metric estimation
 * an abstract wrapper to describe CS scenarios
 * methods for sparsity order estimation
